# 432 Homework 6

Note that this homework is **completely optional**. 

- If you wish to do it, it needs to be completed (by sending an Dr. Love via email with the subject line: `432 Homework 6: My Website` to Dr. Love by the deadline specified on [the Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md).
- If you already have a web presence that is working well for you, you are welcome to revise it in light of some of the guidance provided here, but this is really designed for people who have no current presence online.
- If you are a student in the MS or PhD program in PQHS, I would hope you will take advantage of this opportunity.
- **NEW!** If you want to see some [examples of the work fellow CWRU folks](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/homework/hw06/links.md) were able to do with these tools, [here you go](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/homework/hw06/links.md).

## What are we doing?

Your task is to build a web presence for yourself on the Internet using R Markdown, and specifically a tool called blogdown. The model we're going for is [this one from Wyatt Bensken](https://wyattbensken.com/) (who is a second year PhD student in Epidemiology & Biostatistics and took this course last year.) Ideally, you would include as part of your projects your Project 1 (and perhaps also your Project 2) from this class.

- I'd hoped to have Wyatt come and visit the class, but of course that's not possible now, so [he posted a YouTube video for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBxCk7P9wqE&feature=youtu.be) describing his motivation for doing the work.
- Wyatt [wrote a blog post describing his approach to building his site](https://wyattbensken.com/post/building-website/) which is a strong starting point.
    - Here's [Dan Quintana's 2018 YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox_Ue9yzf-0) on "How to make a personal academic website for free using R and the blogdown package" which is certainly worth a look. [Dan's 2019 tutorial](https://www.dsquintana.blog/free-website-in-r-easy/) is one of Wyatt's key references. 
- Another good source is [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) which describes a lot of available options.

## Why do it?

Successful completion of this assignment will result in a 2 to 4 point bonus for your course grade, depending on how robust your work is. 

- If your site works, and accomplishes the general goal of getting a little bit of your work "out there" in a reasonable way, that's all we're looking for. 
- There's no need to include all of the things that are possible. 
- We'd be very happy with a modest meaningful step in the right direction. 
- There's also no need to spend any money to make this happen.

## Reviewing Your Work

The TAs will be happy to review your work on Homework 6 at any time from now up through 2020-05-01, and they will try to provide suggestions for improvements. Several of them have built websites of their own recently. The TAs can help you with this via `431-help`, or via virtual office hours.

## Submitting the Homework

Submit Homework 6 by sending the link of your website (and any special information you want to pass along) to Dr. Love via email with the subject line: `Homework 6: My Website` by the deadline specified on [the Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md).

This is an individual assignment, but if you want to work together as a group to help each other get a website up and running, that would be terrific.
