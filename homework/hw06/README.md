# 432 Homework 6

Note that this homework is **completely optional**. 

- If you wish to do it for credit, it needs to be completed (by sending an email with the link to Dr. Love) by 5 PM on 2020-05-04. 
- If you already have a web presence that is working well for you, you are welcome to revise it in light of some of the guidance provided here, but this is really designed for people who have no current presence online.
- If you are a student in the MS or PhD program in PQHS, I would hope you will take advantage of this opportunity.

## What are we doing?

Your task is to build a web presence for yourself on the Internet using R Markdown, and specifically a tool called blogdown. The model we're going for is [this one from Wyatt Bensken](https://wyattbensken.com/) (who is a second year PhD student in Epidemiology & Biostatistics and took this course last year.) Ideally, you would include as part of your projects your Project 1 (and perhaps also your Project 2) from this class.

- Wyatt [wrote a blog post describing his approach to building his site](https://wyattbensken.com/post/building-website/) which is a strong starting point.
    - Here's [Dan Quintana's 2018 YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox_Ue9yzf-0) on "How to make a personal academic website for free using R and the blogdown package" which is certainly worth a look. [Dan's 2019 tutorial](https://www.dsquintana.blog/free-website-in-r-easy/) is one of Wyatt's key references. 
- Another good source is [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) which describes a lot of available options.

## Why do it?

Successful completion of this assignment will result in a 2 to 4 point bonus for your course grade, depending on how robust your work is.
