## Grading

Homework assignments 1-4 are graded by the teaching assistants, using a rubric and answer sketch developed together with Dr. Love. We aim to return your grade on each homework to you within 7 days of the assignment's deadline. 

- We will drop your lowest grade across the four homework assignments at the end of the semester in determining your grade. Thus, if you skip one assignment (which is fine - just send a one-page note to Canvas in advance of the deadline telling us you're skipping that homework) it won't count.
- Missing more than one of the first four homeworks is a serious problem - contact Dr. Love directly, in advance, if you're having trouble getting the work done.

### We take deadlines VERY seriously.

This is graduate school. Take the deadlines very seriously. We allow 60 extra minutes for last-second work to appear on Canvas, but after that, late homework receives a severe penalty, because we post answer sketches as quickly as possible after the deadline of each assignment.

### Grading Errors

In grading, we occasionally make errors.

- The teaching assistants will be happy to discuss any homework with you after it is complete, and try to help you understand in more detail how you went wrong. However, protesting your grade to them is pointless, as such protests should be directed only to Dr. Love. 
- If you believe we have simply added up your points on a homework assignment incorrectly, please email Dr. Love directly to describe your concern. You can do this at any time before 5 PM on 2020-04-30.
- **HOMEWORK REGRADES** We do not address more substantial regrade requests on homework assignments 1-4 until the end of the course. Should you wish to request a regrade that isn't just mis-adding up your points on a homework, you will need to fill out the form that Dr. Love has provided at http://bit.ly/432-2020-homework-regrade-requests. The form will be closed at 5 PM on 2020-04-24, and at that time, Dr. Love will review all such requests in a batch.
