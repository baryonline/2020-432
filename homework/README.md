## Grading

Homework assignments are graded by the teaching assistants, using a rubric and answer sketch developed together with Dr. Love. We aim to return your grade on each homework to you within 7 days of the assignment's deadline. 

- We will drop your lowest grade across all of the homework assignments at the end of the semester in determining your grade. Thus, if you skip one assignment (which is fine - just send a one-page note to Canvas in advance of the deadline telling us you're skipping that homework) it won't count.
- Missing more than one assignment is a serious problem - contact Dr. Love directly, in advance, if you're having trouble getting the work done.
- Some assignments may wind up being worth more than others. Dr. Love will make this determination later in the semester.

### We take deadlines VERY seriously.

This is graduate school. Take the deadlines very seriously. We allow 60 extra minutes for last-second work to appear on Canvas, but after that, late homework receives a severe penalty, because we post answer sketches as quickly as possible after the deadline of each assignment.

### Grading Errors

In grading, we occasionally make errors.

- The teaching assistants will be happy to discuss any homework with you after it is complete, and try to help you understand in more detail how you went wrong. However, protesting your grade to them is pointless, as such protests should be directed only to Dr. Love. 
- If you believe we have simply added up your points on a homework assignment incorrectly, please email Dr. Love directly to describe your concern. You can do this at any time before May 1.
- We do not address more substantial regrade requests on homework assignments until May. Should you wish to request a regrade that isn't just mis-adding up your points on a homework, you will need to fill out a form that Dr. Love will provide. Dr. Love will review all such requests in a batch at the end of the semester.
