# 432 Homework 5 

Note that this homework is **completely optional** and is due to Canvas by 5 PM on 2020-04-27. 

## What are we doing?

Your main job is to select a data source from either [the Tidy Tuesday collection](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), or from one of the many available sources of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and create an attractively formatted document (developed using R Markdown) to pull in the data a source on the web, and then present some key element of that data in the form of an effective visualization, accompanied by the results of an appropriate statistical model (which need not be a model using regression.) 

## Parts of the Homework

Your presentation should be brief and focused, and use code-folding set by default to show. You should also provide clear and complete access to your data source. Your presentation should be divided into the following parts:

1. Data Source, Load and Management
2. Your Model
    - An excellent model will use the data in an appropriate way to help us better understand it.
3. Your Visualization
    - An excellent visualization will show the data and help us better understand it.
    - An outstanding visualization and model combination will work well together to improve our understanding.
4. A Discussion 
5. A Summary 

The data source and data management materials should be replicable. We should be able to take your code and be able to replicate your work completely. Restrict your presentation to activities that are necessary for us to replicate your model and visualization, and nothing more. You should provide the final results of your model and visualization, and sufficient code to replicate the work to run the results you want us to see. This assignment is not the place for detailed descriptions of models or validation studies, or most of the things you built in Project 1. We don't want to see intermediate steps printed, or sanity checks. This should basically be a visualization and a model and enough code to create it. Show us exactly what we need to see, and nothing else.

In your **Discussion**, write approximately 250 words in complete English sentences describing the decisions you made in building the visualization and model, and indicating how those decisions were motivated by the 432 course, and by Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics*.

In your **Summary**, summarize the key "takeaways" you want us to obtain from your work, in complete English sentences using **at most** 50 words.

## Why do it?

Successful completion of this assignment will result in a 2 to 4 point bonus for your course grade.

- Good work on each of the five tasks in this homework will result in a 2 point bonus in your overall course grade.
    - "Good work" means that we can use your code to replicate your work exactly, and that we understand the steps involved, and that your visualization is attractive and useful and supported by your model, and that you've completed a coherent discussion and a summary that makes sense.
- Exceptionally strong work may result in an additional 1-2 points of bonus credit, at Dr. Love's discretion.

## Reviewing Your Work

The TAs will be happy to review your work on Homework 5 at any time from now up through 2020-04-24, and they will try to provide suggestions for improvements. They can do this via `431-help`, or via virtual office hours.

## Submitting the Homework
