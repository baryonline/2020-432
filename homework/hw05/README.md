# 432 Homework 5 

Note that this homework is **completely optional**. Successful completion of this assignment will result in a 2 to 4 point bonus for your grade in the course.

- Good work on each of the five tasks in this homework will result in a 2 point bonus in your overall course grade.
- Exceptionally strong work may result in an additional 1-2 points of bonus credit, at Dr. Love's discretion.

Your main job is to select a data source from either [the Tidy Tuesday collection](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), or from one of the many available sources of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and create an attractively formatted document (developed using R Markdown) to pull in the data a source on the web, and then present some key element of that data in the form of an effective visualization, accompanied by the results of an appropriate statistical model (which need not be a model using regression.) 

## Parts of the Homework

Your presentation should be brief and focused, and use code-folding set by default to show. You should also provide clear and complete access to your data source. Your presentation should be divided into the following parts, in whatever order makes the most sense to you:

- The Data Source and Managing the Data
- Your Model
    - An excellent model will use the data in an appropriate way to help us better understand it.
- Your Visualization
    - An excellent visualization will show the data and help us better understand it.
    - An outstanding visualization and model combination will work well together to improve our understanding.
- A Discussion (see below)
- A Summary (see below)

In your **Discussion**, write approximately 250 words in complete English sentences describing the decisions you made in building the visualization and model, and indicating how those decisions were motivated by the 432 course, and by Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics*.

In your **Summary**, summarize the key "takeaways" you want us to obtain from your work, in complete English sentences using **at most** 50 words.
