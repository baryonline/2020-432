# General Instructions

Submit your work via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/). The deadline is
specified on [the Course
Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md).

  - Your response should include an R Markdown file and an HTML document
    that is the result of applying your R Markdown file to the
    `oh_counties_2017.csv` data, available in the main directory for
    this homework, as well as on our Data and Code page.
  - Start a separate R Project for Homework 2, as your first step, and
    place the data in that projectâ€™s directory or (perhaps better) in a
    data sub-directory.
  - In all of our homeworks, do not include R output without complete
    sentences describing what you are doing in each step, and what you
    conclude from that work.

## Data Set for this Assignment

The `oh_counties_2017.csv` data set I have provided describes a series
of variables, pulled from the data for the 88 counties of the the State
of Ohio from the [County Health
Rankings](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/rankings/data/oh) report
for 2017.

  - You may also be interested in looking at the details of the [2017
    Ohio Summary report
    (pdf)](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/sites/default/files/state/downloads/CHR2017_OH.pdf),
    or at the [Excel data
    file](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/sites/default/files/state/downloads/2017%20County%20Health%20Rankings%20Ohio%20Data%20-%20v2.xls)
    from which I created the `oh_counties_2017.csv` file.
  - Note that later data sets are now available, but we will concentrate
    in this assignment on the 2017 results.

The available variables are listed below. Each variable describes data
at the **COUNTY** level.

# Question 1 (20 points)

Create a visualization (using R) based on some part of the
`oh_counties_2017.csv` data set, and share it (the visualization and the
R code you used to build it) with us. The visualization should be of a
professional quality, describe information from at least three different
variables listed above, include proper labels and a title, as well as a
caption of no more than 50 words that highlights the key result.
Although you may fit a model to help show patterns, your primary task is
to show **the data** in a meaningful way, rather than to simply
highlight the results of a model.

  - You are welcome to find useful tools for visualizing data in R that
    we have yet to see in the slides in class, but which youâ€™ve found in
    your reading of David Spiegelhalterâ€™s *The Art of Statistics* or in
    other venues.
  - We will grade Question 1 strictly based on the quality of the
    visualization, its title and caption, in terms of being attractive,
    well-labeled and useful for representing the County Health Rankings
    data for Ohio, and how well it adheres to general principles for
    good visualizations weâ€™ve seen in 431 and 432.

# Question 2 (20 points)

Write an essay (between 150 and 250 words) describing the creation and
meaning of the visualization you created in Question 1, providing us
with the context we need to understand why this is a useful
visualization. In your short description, be sure to address:

  - How does this visualization help its audience understand the data
    better?
  - Why is this particular visualization effective, and what are the
    design features it uses that we can learn from to help us make more
    effective visualizations?

# Question 3 (20 points)

Create a linear regression model to predict `obese_pct` as a function of
`food_env` adjusting for `median_income`, and treating all three
variables as quantitative, using all counties with complete data on
those three variables. Specify and then carefully interpret the
estimated coefficient of `food_env` and a 90% uncertainty interval
around that estimate in context using nothing but complete English
sentences. A model using main effects only, entered as linear
predictors, will be sufficient.

# Question 4 (10 points)

Evaluate the quality of the model you fit in Question 3 in terms of
adherence to regression modeling assumptions, through the specification
and written evaluation of residual plots and other diagnostics. What
might be done to improve the fit of the model youâ€™ve developed in
Question 3? Identify by name any outlying counties, in terms of the
relationship youâ€™re studying, and explain why they are flagged as
outliers.

# Question 5 (20 points)

Create a logistic regression model to predict the presence of a water
violation (as contained in `h2oviol`) on the basis of `sev_housing` and
`pm2.5`. Specify and then carefully interpret the estimated coefficient
of `sev_housing` and a 90% uncertainty interval around that estimate in
context using nothing but complete English sentences. A model using main
effects only, entered as linear predictors, will be sufficient.

# Question 6 (10 points)

Produce and interpret the meaning of a confusion matrix which describes
the quality of the predictions you have developed in Question 5. How
well does the model you fit make predictions about `h2oviol`?

### Please add the session information.

Finally, at the end of this homework and all subsequent assignments
(including the projects), please add the session information. My
preferred way for you to do this is:

``` r
sessioninfo::session_info()
```

### This is the end of Homework 2.
