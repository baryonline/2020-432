# Materials After Quiz 1

- The [Quiz 1 answer sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/quizzes/postquiz1/quiz1_with_sketch.pdf) is available as a PDF file. The PDF includes the entire Quiz, followed by the Results, Sketch and Rubric for each question and overall. 
    - At noon on 2020-03-03, I modified the answer in Question 11 to fix a typo, and explain one of the common errors that I didn't understand previously.
- Your [responses to Question 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/quizzes/postquiz1/quiz1_checkquestion2code.Rmd) are available as an R Markdown file if you want to see what code I received for you. This is also the place to find my specific comments on your coding.
- Grades have been emailed to all students as of 9 AM on 2020-03-03.

The only item I wasn't happy with (in terms of its performance as a question) was Question 7a, where there were clearly two possible interpretations of what I was asking, and the people who did best on the Quiz tended to select a more stringent interpretation than I had in mind. Since it was only worth 1 point, I left it alone.

There were several items where the class as a whole didn't do as well as I would have hoped, as indicated in the Sketch. Any items where less than 75% of credit was awarded are in this group. In preparing for subsequent Quizzes, items with poorer scores on this Quiz are better candidates for me to build related questions in Quizzes 2 and 3 than questions about things where the class in general has already done well, naturally.
