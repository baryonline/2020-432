# 432 Quizzes for Spring 2020

This is where information on the course quizzes will appear. 

- Students will complete between 2 and 4 quizzes this semester - the exact number is not yet determined. All quizzes will be announced in advance and all such announcements will be posted to the web a minimum of one week prior to the Quiz becoming available.
- Quizzes in 432 are open-book, take-home affairs. Some are longer than others. Dr. Love reserves the right to make some Quizzes count more than others in determining your final Quiz grade at the end of the semester.

More to come.
