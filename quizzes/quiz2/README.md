# 432 Quiz 2 Information

Detailed information about Quiz 2 will appear here by 2020-04-03. 
The quiz will be due according to the time and date specified on [the Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md).

The quiz will cover materials associated with Classes 1-22 of 432, with the Course Notes and other materials we've provided by the end of Class 22, and with Chapters 1-13 of David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics*.

- The quiz will be taken using a Google Form.
- You will be provided with a PDF copy of the Quiz, as you were in Quiz 1.

The quiz will be worth 100 points in total, but the highest possible score will actually be 105 points.

- The current plan is for the quiz to consist of no more than 25 items, worth a total of 75 points.
- Students will receive 30 points for on-time submission of the quiz.

Once the Quiz is available, your questions about Quiz items should be asked exclusively via email to 431-help. 

- There, Dr. Love and the TAs will answer questions of clarification regarding the Quiz items to the extent that we can without giving away the correct response.
- While we won't directly answer any of the items on the Quiz, you can create items of your own that are similar (but not the same) as items on the Quiz, and we will (within reason) try to help you with those.

That's all I know for now.
