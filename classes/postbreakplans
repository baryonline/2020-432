# After Spring Break: What's the Plan for 432?

First, please don't panic. My Number One Goal (and that of the TAs) is to be kind to you and to each other. If you're starting to worry about some element of this course, please talk to us. We'll work it out, if there's any way at all to do so. Suffering in silence is the thing to avoid.

Over the next few days, I will 

- work my way through the projects, and 
- plan for the rest of the semester. 

As I come to decisions, I will post them to this page.


## Here's What Dr. Love Knows

1. Our planned class on 2020-03-17 is cancelled.
2. Our planned TA in-person office hours on 2020-03-16 and 2020-03-17 are cancelled, but 431-help is open now and will be through the end of April, at least.
3. We will definitely be having class in some kind of virtual way (with no in-person) option from 2020-03-19 through 2020-04-02.

Everything else is currently unclear.
