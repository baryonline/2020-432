## Today's Announcements

1. Your [Project 1 Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/project1) is due Friday 2020-02-14 at 2 PM.
2. I moved Homework 3 to be due next Tuesday 2020-02-18 at 5 PM, instead of today. You should have everything you need to do that after today's class.
3. I'm updating the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book/). So far,
    - I've added a new Chapter 8, and moved back the old chapters on logistic regression and called them Chapters 9 and 10.
    - I've added a new Chapter 11, focused on some prostate cancer data and cross-validation methods, so that's directly relevant today. I also threw in a little bit of robust linear modeling.
4. I've posted [slides for Classes 9 and 10](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/classes), if you want to see where we're going next in class.

- See [DataMethods](https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/language-for-communicating-frequentist-results-about-treatment-effects/934), too.
    - A *p* value conveys essentially no information when it's large. "Large *p* means (1) at present, with our sample, we cannot bring evidence against the supposition of "no difference" and (2) get more data."
    - [Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence](https://www.bmj.com/content/311/7003/485) from *BMJ* by Douglas Altman 1995. https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.311.7003.485
