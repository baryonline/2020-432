# 432 Spring 2020 Class 15: 2020-03-19

## Connecting to Today's Class via Zoom

- The Zoom meetings for our 432 classes will be open from 12:30 PM to 2:30 PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays, beginning 2020-03-19.
    - The classes themselves will start at 1:00 and end by 2:15, but we want to provide some flexibility at the start and end for students to chat amongst themselves or with Dr. Love.
- **You will need to register in advance for the meeting using the link sent to your email on 2020-03-17 with the subject line "Invitation to Register for Zoom CLASS MEETINGS for 432 with Professor Love (IMPORTANT)".** After you register, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting. 
    - As I understand it, once you've done this registration the first time, you should then be able to join the subsequent class meetings without re-registering, and the meetings should appear on your Zoom calendar and can be added to your Google Calendar or other time management tools.
- Before class, be sure you've logged into [Zoom via CWRU](https://case.edu/utech/help/knowledge-base/zoom/zoom-information) and obtained the application for your computer or tablet.

## Plans for the Rest of the Semester

Here is a [Google Doc](http://bit.ly/432-next-steps) containing (and amplifying on) the emails I've sent this week.

## Virtual TA Office Hours via Zoom

Teaching Assistant Office Hours will be held virtually starting 2020-03-18 and running through 2020-05-01 via [Zoom](https://case.edu/utech/help/knowledge-base/zoom/zoom-information).

- Details on how to access the Zoom office hours were sent to your email on 2020-03-17, under the subject line: "**Office Hours for 432: Connecting to Zoom TA Office Hours in Spring 2020 (IMPORTANT)**"
- You can, of course, also submit questions via `431-help` at any time.

The schedule for TA office hours is provided [in this section of the Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours).

## Announcements

1. **COVID-19** I am compiling some [Data and Resources related to COVID-19](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/covid19resources.md) to help you with Homework 5, and to point you to some potentially useful materials.
2. **Updating R seems like a good idea now.** Version 3.6.3 of R is now available. [I encourage you to upgrade](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/software.md). At the least, you should [update your R packages](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/software.md).
    - The `countreg` package: To build rootograms to visualize the results of regression models on count outcomes, I have decided to use the `countreg` package, which is available **on R-Forge only**. To install `countreg`, type `install.packages("countreg", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")` into the R Console within R Studio.
3. **Updating R Studio is purely optional.** The new version of R Studio (version 1.3.xxxx) is [available for preview](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/). It has [many nice new features](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview-release-notes/), but like all preview versions, installing it may require subsequent re-installs later to fix issues. If you're someone who's comfortable dealing with those sorts of issues, feel free to upgrade, but continuing with version 1.2.5033 for the rest of the semester is an equally fine choice.
