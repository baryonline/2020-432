## Announcements

1. I am compiling some [Data and Resources related to COVID-19](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/covid19resources.md) to help you with Homework 5, and to point you to some potentially useful materials.
2. Updating R. R version 3.6.3 is now available. [I encourage you to upgrade](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/software.md). At the least, you should [update your R packages](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/software.md).
    - The `countreg` package: To build rootograms to visualize the results of regression models on count outcomes, I have decided to use the `countreg` package, which is available **on R-Forge only**. To install `countreg`, type `install.packages("countreg", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")` into the R Console within R Studio.
