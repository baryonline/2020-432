## Announcements

1. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 14 will appear at http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute14-feedback.
2. Here's the logistic regression example ([in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class15/logistic_example_2020-03-06.Rmd) and [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class15/logistic_example_2020-03-06.pdf)) that I built to demonstrate some things for Project 1, using the `lind` data from Quiz 1.

## In The News

1. [COVID-19 Epidemiology with R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2020/03/05/covid-19-epidemiology-with-r/) by Tim Churches 2020-03-05. 
    - The [`coronavirus` package] provides a daily summary of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases by state/province. Data source: [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/)
2. [How Working-Class Life Is Killing Americans, in Charts](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/06/opinion/working-class-death-rate.html) by David Leonhardt and Stuart A. Thompson, *NY Times* 2020-03-06.
3. [R Studio 1.3 is out in preview](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/). This is a major new release with some [appealing new features](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview-release-notes/). I wouldn't recommend switching over this semester to anyone who isn't comfortable with dealing with less-well-tested software, and I certainly wouldn't do it in the middle of working on anything important, but I'm experimenting with it a bit.
4. [ggplot2 version 3.3.0 is now available on CRAN](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/ggplot2-3-3-0/). There are some useful new features in this release, and I wouldn't expect anything to break in your current code.
