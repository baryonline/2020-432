## Today's Announcements

1. The [Homework 3 Answer Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/homework/hw03) (including the grading rubric) is available now.
2. Reactions from Dr. Love and the TAs to all [Project 1 Proposals](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/project1#deliverable-1-the-proposal) have been posted to Canvas.
    - Everyone needs to do at least some little revision, except for the one pair of folks who've already completed theirs. 
    - All revisions for Project 1 proposals should go to the same place in Canvas where you submitted the initial draft, and **all** Project 1 Proposal revisions are due at 9 AM on Monday 2020-02-24. 
    - We encourage early submission of these revisions and additional conversation with the TAs or Dr. Love via email to 431-help or in person as you move forward. If your revision doesn't reach the level of approval (and a score of 10), you'll know that as soon as we can tell you (likely by Monday afternoon), and you'll have to revise it again, and that revision will be due at 9 AM Wednesday 2020-02-26.
    - If your initial grade on the proposal was below 8, we especially encourage you to complete your revision quickly, so that we can review it over the weekend and get you on track to a 10 as quickly as possible. 
    - Please address all the things we listed in Canvas for you to work on, **as well as** [the list of items provided in the Some Additional Thoughts After Reviewing the Proposal Drafts](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/project1#new-some-additional-thoughts-after-reviewing-the-proposal-drafts) section of the Project 1 instructions.

3. We've [updated the Project 1 Instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/project1) now to show you everything you'll need to do for the Portfolio in detail (once your proposal is approved) and to clarify some important issues and changes in the plan. Please take a look.

4. I got a great email the other day from Carli Lehr, a physician on staff at the Cleveland Clinic, who took 432 and 500 in recent cycles...

> I wanted to share an article I wrote that was recently accepted using propensity score methodology. This study was a direct result of the project from your PQHS 500 course. This project helped me obtain a grant from the Cleveland Clinic, was featured on Sirius Doctor Radio, and has been used by the Cleveland Clinic Media department to educate our transplant patients (neat study video on this site). 

> Thank you for your patience and time in helping me learn how to think critically about study design and analysis.  

- Here's a [copy of Carli's paper](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class05/JCVTS_Lehr_2020.pdf), written with her colleagues at CCF.
- The link to the [study video is here](https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2019/12/05/cleveland-clinic-study-using-lungs-from-increased-risk-donors-expands-donor-pool-while-maintaining-current-survival-rates/).

5. Susan Gross, who took the 431-432 sequence with me a few years ago, writes...

> I ... am currently using the skills I learned in those courses in my job as a Data Analyst at OverDrive (a Cleveland-based company that sells digital ebooks and audiobooks to libraries). I have the pleasure of working in R all day every day, which is pretty much a dream job for me. I wanted to write to thank you again ... and also to inquire about any outstanding students who would be interested in applying for a full-time entry-level position in Cleveland. I know that any applicants who did well in your 431/432 class and enjoyed the material should do very well in this position. As an aside, the longer this primary season goes, the more interesting [538's Model Talk](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/model-talk/) gets! I hope you're enjoying it!

- Here's [the link to the Data Analyst position at Overdrive](https://company.overdrive.com/careers/?p=job%2Fo7azbfwL#positions), if you're interested.
- You might be interested, too, in Nate Silver's latest [demonstration of how to write about fixing a bug in your model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-fixed-a-mistake-in-how-our-primary-forecast-was-calculating-candidates-demographic-strengths/).
- Here is the [FiveThirtyEight Democratic Primary Forecast](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/), if you want to track how last night's debate changes things going forward.

6. [The Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md) now shows planned topics of discussion through Class 20. Materials we've already worked through have been moved down the page.

7. Quiz 1 covers materials through the first 11 classes, including today, and Chapters 1-5 and 7-8 of Spiegelhalter's *Art of Statistics*. It will have either 14 or 15 questions.
