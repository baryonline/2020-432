## Today's Announcements

1. In Homework 3 Question 5, I changed the question this morning. It now reads: For the model you selected in Question 4, interpret the odds ratio associated with the ldl main effect carefully, specifying a 90% uncertainty interval and what we can conclude from the results. 
This should shorten the needed response considerably. If you've already turned in the homework with a more complete assessment, OK, but in reviewing the answer sketch, I feel the need to shorten the interpretation requirement.
