## Today's Announcements

1. In [Homework 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/homework/hw03) Question 5, I changed the question this morning. It now reads: 

> For the model you selected in Question 4, interpret the odds ratio associated with the ldl main effect carefully, specifying a 90% uncertainty interval and what we can conclude from the results. 

This should shorten the needed response considerably. If you've already turned in the homework with a more complete assessment, OK, but in reviewing the answer sketch, I feel the need to shorten the interpretation requirement.

2. The TAs have completed an initial review of your Project Proposals. Now, it's up to me to look them over and release next steps. That should happen before class on Thursday.
