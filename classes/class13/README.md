## Today's Key Topic

Ridge Regression and the Lasso.

## Today's Announcements

1. Dr. Love will hold additional **walk-in office hours** on Tuesday 2020-03-03 and Thursday 2020-03-05 from Noon to 12:45 and from 2:15 to 3 PM in Wood WG82-J specifically to help address questions related to project 1 portfolio and/or poster work. 
    - I'm hoping you'll use this opportunity to show me something specific from your portfolio or from your poster and ask for advice about how to present something most effectively. 
    - This is just to help supplement the TA office hours, which will continue to be held as usual.
    - If you have a question about coding, it's generally more effective for you to send your R Markdown and csv and a description of the problem you're having to 431-help, or to visit TA office hours.
2. Quiz 1: I've finished grading and sent you my thoughts via email. 
    - Post-Quiz materials are posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/quizzes/postquiz1). This includes: 
        - the [Answer Sketch, Rubric and Results document](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/quizzes/postquiz1/quiz1_with_sketch.pdf) (which I updated at noon today to fix Question 11's answer) and 
        - the [R Markdown of code and evaluation for Question 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/quizzes/postquiz1/quiz1_checkquestion2code.Rmd).
    - If you didn't do as well as you'd hoped, I'm sorry. I hope you all do very well on the next Quiz.
    - As a group, there were some questions ([answer sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/quizzes/postquiz1/quiz1_with_sketch.pdf) has results for each item) where less than 75% of available points were awarded. Those are the questions I'll be looking at again when I develop Quizzes 2 and 3. 
    - I thought every item was reasonable except maybe Question 7a, but since that was only 1 point, I left it alone.
    - In the Minute Paper after Thursday's class, I'll be asking you how long it took you to do the Quiz.
    - My bonus office hours today and Thursday are designed to be about the project 1 portfolio and poster. Please stick with that, rather than using the time to rehash the Quiz. 
        - There's not much we can do now about Quiz 1 (and whatever we can do, we can probably do via email), but there's a lot we can do about Project 1, and it's far more important for your grade in the course.
        - The 3 Quizzes (Quiz 1 worth 75 points, Quiz 2 worth 75 points, Quiz 3 worth 100 points) combined are worth 15-25% of your course grade. The 2 Projects are together worth 40% of your Course Grade.
3. Homework 3 grades were posted on 2020-02-27 to http://bit.ly/432-2020-grades. 
    - We built a [Google Doc containing several of the essays we really enjoyed in response to Question 6](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krZRnMTniOKfU0EqlE-dnJjqP4n7hBgFB7JSPN-x8mQ/edit?usp=sharing).
4. *Homework Regrades*. A reminder...
    - If we've added your points up incorrectly on a Homework, send an email to Dr. Love before 5 PM 2020-04-30.
    - To request a Homework regrade for any other reason, fill out the Form at http://bit.ly/432-2020-homework-regrade-requests  any time before 5 PM on 2020-04-30. Dr. Love will review all of those requests in a batch then. [See the Grading Errors section here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/homework/README.md#grading-errors) for a little more detail.
5. [Instructions for Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/homework/hw04) are now available.
6. Minute Paper after Class 12 feedback is available at http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute12-feedback.
7. In response to some Minute Paper questions about non-linearity, spending degrees of freedom and the Spearman rho-squared plot, [I wrote up some thoughts](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class13/nonlinearity.md). Please take a look. I also encourage you to look closely at the relevant sections of [the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book).
8. There have been several updates to the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book), in particular there's a new Chapter 16 on Multiple Imputation (with `mice` and with `aregImpute`) in Linear Regression.
9. [Project 2 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/project2) are started, and the rest will appear on 2020-03-17 by 1 PM. The answer to all questions not already answered there is probably "I'm not sure. It depends on how Project 1 goes."
