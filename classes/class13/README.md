### About the Class

1. Quiz 1 results should **appear by class time, I hope**.
2. Homework 3 grades were posted on 2020-02-27 to http://bit.ly/432-2020-grades. 
    - We built a [Google Doc containing several of the essays we really enjoyed in response to Question 6](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krZRnMTniOKfU0EqlE-dnJjqP4n7hBgFB7JSPN-x8mQ/edit?usp=sharing).
3. *Homework Regrades*. Should you wish to request a regrade that isn't just mis-adding up your points on a homework, fill out the form that Dr. Love has provided at http://bit.ly/432-2020-homework-regrade-requests at any time before 5 PM on 2020-04-30. Dr. Love will review all of those requests in a batch at that time. Also, [see the Grading Errors section here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/homework/README.md#grading-errors).
4. I hope to post Homework 4 **by class time**. It is due at 5 PM on 2020-03-23.
4. Minute Paper after Class 12 feedback is available at http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute12-feedback.
5. Project 2 instructions will appear on 2020-03-17 by 1 PM. The answer to all of the complicated questions I've heard so far about Project 2 is "I'm not sure. It depends on how Project 1 goes."

### Other Things
