### About the Class

1. Quiz 1 results should **appear by class time, I hope**.
2. I expect to post instructions for Homework 4 **by class time**. It is due at 5 PM on 2020-03-23.
3. Homework 3 grades were posted on 2020-02-27 to http://bit.ly/432-2020-grades. 
    - We built a [Google Doc containing several of the essays we really enjoyed in response to Question 6](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krZRnMTniOKfU0EqlE-dnJjqP4n7hBgFB7JSPN-x8mQ/edit?usp=sharing).
4. *Homework Regrades*. A reminder...
    - If we've added your points up incorrectly on a Homework, send an email to Dr. Love at any time before 5 PM 2020-04-30.
    - To request a Homework regrade for any other reason, fill out the Form at http://bit.ly/432-2020-homework-regrade-requests  any time before 5 PM on 2020-04-30. Dr. Love will review all of those requests in a batch then. [See the Grading Errors section here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/homework/README.md#grading-errors) for a little more detail.
5. Minute Paper after Class 12 feedback is available at http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute12-feedback.
6. In response to some Minute Paper questions about non-linearity, spending degrees of freedom and the Spearman rho-squared plot, [I wrote up some thoughts](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class13/nonlinearity.md). Please take a look. I also encourage you to look closely at the relevant sections of [the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book).
7. Project 2 instructions will appear on 2020-03-17 by 1 PM. The answer to all of the complicated questions I've heard so far about Project 2 is "I'm not sure. It depends on how Project 1 goes."
8. Dr. Love will hold additional **walk-in office hours** on Thursday 2020-03-05 from Noon to 12:45 and from 2:15 to 3 PM in Wood WG82-J specifically to help address questions related to project 1 portfolio and/or poster work. This is just to help supplement the TA office hours. I'm hoping you'll use this to show me something specific about your planned and ask for advice. If you have a coding question, it's better

### Other Things

## One Last Thing

The map above [appeared in an article on CNBC.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/26/people-skipping-medically-necessary-drugs-because-they-cost-too-much.html) on 2020-02-26.

[Alyssa Keiko](https://twitter.com/alyssakeiko/status/1233092947987529728) tweeted it out, saying "I have a lot of questions about if anyone looked at this map before during or after its making"

Any thoughts as to what happened here?

[Sam Ventura on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stat_sam/status/1233191157053693953?s=11) has the answer, I think...

If you're concerned about Alabama, later in that thread, Sam reminds us that 

> Wyoming + 1 = Alabama, if you go 'round the corner.

By 2020-02-28, CNBC corrected the map, which now looks like this:
