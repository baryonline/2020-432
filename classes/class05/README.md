## Today's Announcements

1. The [Class 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/classes/class03) and [Class 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/classes/class04) Slides have been edited to reflect what we actually discussed each day, and reposted accordingly.
2. Thank you for completing the [Minute Paper after Class 4](http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-04). By now, I hope you've had the chance to [review the feedback I posted Friday](http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-04-feedback). Our next Minute Paper will be after Class 6.
3. When sending us a request for help at **431-help** it's extremely helpful for you to send your entire R Markdown file, in addition to pointing out whatever specific issue is concerning you. This will help us respond faster and more accurately.
4. **On jittering in an interaction plot**. A student pointed out to me that the jittering in one of our plots was a bit confusing. [Here's a quick example displaying the problem and a possible solution](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class05/quick_example.md).
