- When Zoom finishes its processing, [the link to the Class 17 recording will go here].
- The [Google Doc of Notes During Class](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VpnXK654mVLJKMnbxMyhvLSEaOwyZhO2itaMf1a3N4U/edit?usp=sharing) is a place for you to communicate with Dr. Love and the rest of us (and for Dr. Love to remind himself of things) during class, especially if you cannot connect to the Zoom Chat. I'll also leave some follow-up there after each class as needed, on things that come up in the chat, etc.
