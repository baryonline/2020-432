- The [Google Doc of Notes During Class](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VpnXK654mVLJKMnbxMyhvLSEaOwyZhO2itaMf1a3N4U/edit?usp=sharing) is a white board for communication with Dr. Love and the rest of us (and for Dr. Love to remind himself of things) during class, especially if you cannot connect to the Zoom Chat.

## Announcements

1. From my email on Friday: a student had asked:

> For our project 2, what kinds of outcomes / models are appropriate?

- I can think of six good choices, and they are:
    1. Quantitative outcome leading to linear regression
    2. Binary outcome leading to logistic regressionÂ 
    3. Count outcome leading to a Poisson or Negative Binomial regression (with or without hurdle or zero-inflation augmentations) - also OK to consider a censored (tobit) model here as described in the Course Notes but not in class (at least not yet)
    4. Ordered multi-categorical outcome leading to a proportional odds logistic regression
    5. Unordered multi-categorical outcome leading to a multinomial regression
    6. Survival (time-to-event) outcome with right-censoring, leading to a Cox proportional hazards regression (will be discussed but not yet discussed)
- I can't think of another good option, but any of those six would be fine, assuming the other elements of the proposal worked out well.

2. More to come.
