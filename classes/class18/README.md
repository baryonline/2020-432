## Announcements

1. From my email on Friday: a student asked

> For our project 2, what kinds of outcomes / models are appropriate?

- I identified six broad types of outcomes and models [in this section of the Project 2 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/projects/project2/README.md#what-kinds-of-outcomesmodels-are-appropriate-for-project-2).

2. Project 1 feedback went out to you via email on Saturday 2020-03-28.
    - Extensive details on the Project 1 feedback and the Projects themselves [are available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/projects/project1/feedback/details.md).
    - Remember that the grading structure for this course is described at http://bit.ly/432-2020-grading-plan. You should now have all of the information you need to calculate your mid-term percentage and your mid-term grade.
        - If you turn in a complete Quiz 2 and a complete Project 2 on time, your grade will not decrease from your mid-term grade. If you cannot turn those items in on time, contact Dr. Love (as soon as you can) and we'll work something out.

3. Feedback on the [Minute Paper after Class 17 is available here](http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-17-feedback).
    - I want to be sure I hear from each of you every week, so if you don't complete the Minute Paper, I'll be emailing you to get a reply.
