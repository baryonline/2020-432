## Announcements

1. I would really like to play to an audience today. If a few of you (maybe 3-4 people) are willing to turn on your cameras, that would be great.

2. From my email on Friday: a student asked

> For our project 2, what kinds of outcomes / models are appropriate?

- I identified six broad types of outcomes and models [in this section of the Project 2 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/projects/project2/README.md#what-kinds-of-outcomesmodels-are-appropriate-for-project-2).

3. Project 1 feedback went out to you via email on Saturday 2020-03-28.
    - Extensive details on the Project 1 feedback and the Projects themselves [are available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/projects/project1/feedback/details.md).
    - Remember that the grading structure for this course is described at http://bit.ly/432-2020-grading-plan. You should now have all of the information you need to calculate your mid-term percentage and your mid-term grade.

4. Ten early [project 2 proposals are already in at the Google Form](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/projects/project2/proposals/review.md). I'll review in detail the 10 I have posted there later today. Everyone else, remember that your proposal (Google Form) is due at noon tomorrow (2020-04-01.)

5. An important note (updated in [the grading plan](http://bit.ly/432-2020-grading-plan)) that I want to emphasize.

Thanks to COVID-19, or life in general, some of you will not be able to complete one or both of Project 2 and Quiz 2 on time. I would strongly prefer that you do something to finish out the semester, even if you find yourself in an impossibly difficult situation as things move forward. If you cannot turn one or both of those items in on time, let Dr. Love know, as soon as you can, and he'll pass along the emergency alternate assignments he has created. 

- There are separate alternative assignments (each is capped at 60 minutes of your time) for Project 2 and Quiz 2. Just let Dr. Love know which one you need, or if you need both, as the need arises. 
- Each of the alternate assignments will be due at noon on 2020-05-04, and can be done by you as early as tomorrow, as each requires only material we've discussed before April.
- Completing these assignments will be treated as sufficient for your grade to only improve from where it was at the Midterm.
- I guarantee that doing the actual assignments will improve your grade more than doing the alternates, but at least this way some improvement from the Midterm is possible even if you cannot complete the real assignments.

6. Feedback on the [Minute Paper after Class 17 is available here](http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-17-feedback).
    - I want to be sure I hear from each of you every week, so if you don't complete the Minute Paper, I'll be emailing you to get a reply.
    
7. Homework 4 grades are now posted to http://bit.ly/432-2020-grades. I'm not planning to build a revision to the [Answer Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/homework/hw04) now, since the only things I really have to add are:
    - I don't really know why some people got slightly different multiple imputation results than I did with "the same" code, except that if you impute things in a different order, or if you convert things to factors, things can change a little. But why you got different answers with identical code on different laptops? I don't know.
    - Once I did the simple imputation, I should have used it in the Spearman rho-square plot, but I didn't in building the Hints so I stuck with that poor decision.

8. Quiz 2 will be in your hands ([well, virtually](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/quizzes/quiz2)) on Friday at 5 PM. The TAs are reviewing it now.
