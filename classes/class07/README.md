## Today's Announcements

1. I revised the Week 3 Slides ([PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class06/432_2020_week03.pdf), [RMarkdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class06/432_2020_week03.Rmd)) to fix a typo in the denominator of Specificity in slide 39.
2. I added the [ModernDive example with interaction and parallel slope plots](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class06/modern_dive_example.md) that were missing in Class 6.
