## Announcements

1. I revised the [Hint for Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/homework/hw04/homework4_hints_2020-03-21.pdf) on 2020-03-21 to clarify that we only use the simple imputation in Question 4 and 5, but not in the remainder of the Homework.

2. To install the `countreg` package we'll need to build rootograms to visualize the results of regression models on count outcomes, type `install.packages("countreg", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")` into the R Console within R Studio.

3. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 15 will be posted when available.

4. The Class Notes will be revised as soon as possible.

5. Project 1 grading continues. Details will be posted.
