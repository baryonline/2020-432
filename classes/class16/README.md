- The Google Doc of Notes During Class linked above is a place for you to communicate with Dr. Love and the rest of us (and for Dr. Love to remind himself of things) during class, especially if you cannot connect to the Zoom Chat.

## Announcements

1. Please do not assume we know what you're going through. If you're having trouble with anything related to the course, large or small, please ask.

2. I revised the [Hint for Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/homework/hw04/homework4_hints_2020-03-21.pdf) on 2020-03-21 to clarify that we only use the simple imputation in Question 4 and 5, but not in the remainder of the Homework.

3. [Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 15](https://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-15-feedback) is now available.
    - Thanks for responding.
    - One question I want to be sure to addresss was "... if we're presenting with a partner, are the two presentations supposed to complement each other or should they describe the same information, but in our own separate words (as if we were presenting alone)?"
     - The former. In your video presentation, we want one of you to give the first half of the full presentation, and the other to give the second half. You're not giving two different versions of the same material - you're each presenting half of the complete presentation.

4. I've had to change the 432 Class Zoom sessions to no longer allow you to sign in before I do. 
    - I will try to open each session at about 12:45 PM, and I will stay on the line until everyone else is gone after class. I changed this to stop accidental log-ins to reduce the delay in Zoom processing the recordings.

5. Chapters 19 and 20 of the [Class Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book/) will appear as soon as possible.

6. Project 1 grading continues. I am hoping to have grades for you all by class time Thursday. It won't be sooner than that.

7. To install the `countreg` package we'll need to build rootograms to visualize the results of regression models on count outcomes, type `install.packages("countreg", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")` into the R Console within R Studio.

8. I am not in the "looking at COVID-19 data" business today, but I added to [our resources list](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/covid19resources.md) a link to [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's covid19-r repository](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/covid19-r/blob/master/README.md) which gathers analyses on and representations of COVID-19 data in R.
    - A post I found interesting: ["Ten Considerations Before You Create Another Chart About COVID-19"](https://medium.com/nightingale/ten-considerations-before-you-create-another-chart-about-covid-19-27d3bd691be8)
