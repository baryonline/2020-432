## Today's Announcements

1. One thing I haven't gotten to you yet is a revised version of [the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book/). Coming soon, I hope. In the interim, remember that [the 2019 version is still available](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/).
2. [Project 1 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/project1) are now available.
    - You'll find a [README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/project1) which describes the proposal, which is [due in mid-February (the calendar has the details)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md).
    - You'll also find a [rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/projects/project1/project1_proposal_rubric.md) showing how the teaching assistants will evaluate your proposal.
    - Additional instructions will appear by the end of January describing the Project 1 portfolio and poster, which are due in March.
    - Instructions regarding Project 2 will appear later this semester.
    - There will be a special class in late February where you'll meet in small groups to share ideas about your project 1 work, with the TAs and each other. That's now [on the Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md).
3. Canvas is now open. 
    - For all 432 Homework assignments, the deadline posted in [the Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md) is one hour earlier than the cutoff for "late" assignments posted on Canvas. There will be no penalty for Homework received before the Canvas deadline. This "one extra hour" policy applies only to Homework and not to other types of 432 assignments.
4. The [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md) now lists the date for [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/quizzes) in late February, and the deadlines for the two major Project 1 tasks: the Proposal in mid-February and the Poster/Portfolio in early March.
5. There is no Minute Paper today. We will do one after Thursday's class.
6. James Densmore curated a nice list of [Free Data Science Books](https://www.dataliftoff.com/free-data-science-books/) at DataLiftoff, if you're interested.
7. [Alex Cookson built a great resource](https://twitter.com/alexcookson/status/1216798492183670784?s=11).

## One Last Thing

Today we have another of the [Best Data Visualization Projects of 2019](https://flowingdata.com/2019/12/19/best-data-visualization-projects-of-2019/) as identified by Nathan Yau at [flowingdata.com](https://flowingdata.com/). 

- This effort, built by Karim Douïeb, involves [the "impeach this" map of the 2016 US Presidential Election transitioning to a cartogram](https://flowingdata.com/2019/10/08/fixing-the-impeach-this-map-with-a-transition-to-a-cartogram/). 
- [Here is the live code version](https://observablehq.com/@karimdouieb/try-to-impeach-this-challenge-accepted) should you want to play around with the county-to-bubble transitions in the map.
