# 432 Spring 2020 Class 04: 2020-01-23

## Key Materials

- Today's slides are [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class04/432_2020_slides04.pdf) and [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class04/432_2020_slides04.Rmd) formats.
    - We'll actually start today's class with Slide 55 from Class 3, and I'm certain we won't get through all of the slides contained in Slide Set 4 today, so we'll pick up wherever we leave off next Tuesday in Class 5.
- Today's audio recording will be found on [our shared drive](http://bit.ly/432-2020-audio) at http://bit.ly/432-2020-audio.
- Get help at any time by emailing **431-help at case dot edu**.
- The main website for the course is https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432.

## Today's Announcements

1. Our department (PQHS) worked through the process of ensuring that all students in 432 have ID access to the Robbins and Wood buildings on weekdays. My understanding is that this is now done for all students except those who didn't have an ID (or had an expired one) with Security. I sent those folks an email yesterday. So I hope you now have weekday building access for the rest of the semester.
2. There is a Minute Paper after Class 4. **Details to come.**
3. I added `posterdown` to the recommended packages list.
    - Learn more about `posterdown` [at its repository](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown), and with this [installation and usage guide](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/wiki/Installation-&-Usage-Guide). You'll be using this tool to build your e-poster for Project 1.

More to come.
