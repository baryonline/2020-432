# 432 Spring 2020 Class 04: 2020-01-23

## Key Materials

- Today's slides are [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class04/432_2020_slides04.pdf) and [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/classes/class04/432_2020_slides04.Rmd) formats.
    - The slides have now been edited to describe only the materials we actually covered in class 4, and to fix a typo on the top of slide 39, where Sally's predicted BMI was miscalculated.
- Today's audio recording will be found on [our shared drive](http://bit.ly/432-2020-audio) at http://bit.ly/432-2020-audio.
- Get help at any time by emailing **431-help at case dot edu**.

## Today's Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 4](http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-04). Please visit http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-04 to complete the form by Friday at 2 PM.
2. Our department (PQHS) worked through the process of ensuring that all students in 432 have ID access to the Robbins and Wood buildings on weekdays. My understanding is that this is now done for all students except those who didn't have an ID (or had an expired one) with Security. I sent those folks an email yesterday. So I hope you now have weekday building access for the rest of the semester.
3. I added `posterdown` to the recommended packages list.
    - Learn more about `posterdown` [at its repository](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown), and with this [installation and usage guide](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/wiki/Installation-&-Usage-Guide). You'll be using this tool to build your e-poster for Project 1.
4. Martin Monkman has published [Data Science with R: A Resource Compendium](https://bookdown.org/martin_monkman/DataScienceResources_book/) which is clearly a work in progress, but has lots of links (some, admittedly, dead) to all sorts of things that are useful.

## One Last Thing

When we read graphs, we use a variety of cognitive shortcuts, leading to either better or biased interpretations. Steven Franconeri has an interesting post at Medium about what cognitive science tells us about these ideas, and how we can improve our decision-making. The post is "[Multiple views on how to choose a visualization](https://medium.com/multiple-views-visualization-research-explained/multiple-views-on-how-to-choose-a-visualization-b3ffc99fcddc)" and it is definitely worth your time.

- There is a related "[Quick Reference Guide](http://experception.net/)" downloadable pdf which I recommend heartily.
- Don't forget about the [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/), in particular the one for Data Visualization, and the [associated set of references for the ggplot2 package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/).
