## Today's Agenda

1. Continuing our discussion of two-way ANOVA and ANCOVA with binary factors
2. Building a two-factor ANOVA model with multi-categorical factors
    - again, focus on interpreting the interaction
    - add covariates, as desired

## Setup

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(here); library(magrittr); library(janitor)
library(broom); library(simputation); library(patchwork)
library(naniar); library(visdat)
library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_bw())

smart1 <- readRDS(here("data/smart1.Rds"))
smart1_sh <- readRDS(here("data/smart1_sh.Rds"))
```

## `smart1_sh` Variables, by Type

Variable | Type | Description
--------- | :----: | --------------------------------
`landline` | Binary (1/0) | survey conducted by landline? (vs. cell)
`healthplan` | Binary (1/0) | subject has health insurance?
`age_imp` | Quantitative | age (imputed from groups - see Notes)
`fruit_day` | Quantitative | mean servings of fruit / day
`drinks_wk` | Quantitative | mean alcoholic drinks / week
`bmi` | Quantitative | body-mass index (in kg/m^2^)
`physhealth` | Count (0-30) | of last 30 days, # in poor physical health
`dm_status` | Categorical | diabetes status (now 2 levels)
`activity` | Categorical | physical activity level (4 levels)
`smoker` | Categorical | tobacco use status (now 3 levels)
`genhealth` | Categorical | self-reported overall health (5 levels)

# Modeling with ANOVA for Binary Factors

## Models we have fit (so far)

```{r}
a1 <- smart1_sh %$% lm(bmi ~ dm_status)

a2 <- smart1_sh %$% lm(bmi ~ dm_status * healthplan)

a2_noint <- smart1_sh %$% lm(bmi ~ dm_status + healthplan)
```

## Is the interaction term important here?

1. Does the interaction plot display important non-parallelism?
2. Does the interaction term account for a substantial fraction of the variation in our outcome?
3. Does the interaction term's estimate/standard error/uncertainty interval meet usual standards for statistical significance?

If **all** of these things are true, then it's easy to conclude that the interaction is important, and we cannot interpret the main effects of `dm_status` and `healthplan` without thinking first about the interaction of those two factors.

- So let's walk through the decision. I've repeated the interaction plot on the next slide.

## Interaction Plot 

We'll plot the means of the `bmi` in the four combinations:

- two levels of `dm_status` combined with
- two levels of `healthplan`

```{r}
summaries1 <- smart1_sh %>% 
  group_by(dm_status, healthplan) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), mean = mean(bmi), stdev = sd(bmi))

summaries1 %>% knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

## Interaction Plot for Two-Way ANOVA (code)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pd <- position_dodge(0.1)
ggplot(summaries1, aes(x = dm_status, y = mean,
                       col = factor(healthplan))) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - stdev,
                    ymax = mean + stdev),
                width = 0.1, position = pd) +
  geom_point(size = 2, position = pd) +
  geom_line(aes(group = healthplan), position = pd) +
  labs(y = "Body-Mass Index",
       x = "Diabetes?",
       title = "Observed Means (+/- SD) for BMI", 
       subtitle = "by Diabetes Status and Insurance")
```

## Interaction Plot for Two-Way ANOVA

```{r, echo = FALSE}
pd <- position_dodge(0.1)
ggplot(summaries1, aes(x = dm_status, y = mean,
                       col = factor(healthplan))) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - stdev,
                    ymax = mean + stdev),
                width = 0.1, position = pd) +
  geom_point(size = 2, position = pd) +
  geom_line(aes(group = healthplan), position = pd) +
  labs(y = "Body-Mass Index",
       x = "Diabetes?",
       title = "Observed Means (+/- SD) for BMI", 
       subtitle = "by Diabetes Status and Insurance")
```

## Evaluation in our Two-Way ANOVA of Interaction

1. Does the interaction plot display important non-parallelism?
    - No, I don't think so. 
2. Does the interaction term account for a substantial fraction of the variation in our outcome?

```{r}
anova(a2) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 0)
```

- SS(total) = 288,338 + 30 + 3 + 14,775 = 303,146.
- SS(interaction) = 30
- $\eta^2$(interaction) = $\frac{30}{303146} = .000099$, or about 0.01% of `bmi` variation.

## Is the interaction term important here?

1. Does the interaction plot display important non-parallelism?
    - No.
2. Does the interaction term account for a substantial fraction of the variation in our outcome?
    - It accounts for just under 0.01% of variation, so no.
3. Does the interaction term's estimate/standard error/uncertainty interval meet usual standards for statistical significance?

```{r}
tidy(a2, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.90) %>%
  select(term, estimate, std.error, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

## Is the interaction term important here?

1. Does the interaction plot display important non-parallelism?
  - No.
2. Does the interaction term account for a substantial fraction of the variation in our outcome?
  - No.
3. Does the interaction term's estimate/standard error/uncertainty interval meet usual standards for statistical significance?
  - No.

It's clearly easier to ignore the interaction term (and fit the no-interaction model) if none of these three things are true.

## Interpreting the "No Interaction" Model

```{r}
tidy(a2_noint, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.90) %>%
  select(term, estimate, std.error, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

- If Harry and Sally have the same `healthplan` status, but only Harry has diabetes, then Harry's BMI is estimated to be 3.97 kg/m^2^ higher than Sally's. (90% uncertainty interval: 3.63, 4.30).
- If Harry and Sally have the same `dm_status` but Harry has a health plan and Sally doesn't, our model will estimate Harry's BMI as 0.09 kg/m^2^ higher than Sally's (90% interval: -0.44, 0.62).

## Adding a covariate

We saw that the no-interaction model might well be sufficient for BMI as a function of `dm_status` and `healthplan`. Would this still be true if we first adjusted for the impact of a continuous covariate, like `physhealth`, that is meaningfully correlated with BMI?

```{r}
a3 <- smart1_sh %$% 
  lm(bmi ~ physhealth + dm_status * healthplan)

anova(a3) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

## Model without the Covariate

Compare that ANOVA table to this one for our interaction model without the covariate. What changes?

```{r}
anova(a2) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

## `a3` covariate model without interaction term

```{r}
a3_noint <- smart1_sh %$% 
  lm(bmi ~ physhealth + dm_status + healthplan)

anova(a3_noint) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

## Interpreting "No Interaction" Model + Covariate

```{r}
tidy(a3_noint, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.90) %>%
  select(term, estimate, std.error, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

- If Harry and Sally have the same `healthplan` status and the same `physhealth`, but only Harry has diabetes, then Harry's BMI is estimated to be 3.67 kg/m^2^ higher than Sally's. (90% uncertainty interval: 3.33, 4.01).
- See next slide, too.

## Interpreting "No Interaction" Model + Covariate

```{r}
tidy(a3_noint, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.90) %>%
  select(term, estimate, std.error, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

- If Harry and Sally have the same `dm_status` and the same `physhealth`, but Harry has a health plan and Sally doesn't, our model will estimate Harry's BMI as 0.03 kg/m^2^ higher than Sally's (90% uncertainty interval: -0.50, 0.56).
- Why aren't I talking here about the covariate's effect?

## Does the model fit the data well?

We have the usual strategies applicable in any linear model:

- evaluate the R^2^ and other summary statistics, especially in comparison to alternative specifications of models for the same outcome.
- evaluate the fit of the model to regression assumptions, mostly through diagnostics based on residuals
- cross-validate our model selection process, perhaps by partitioning the sample into a training sample (where candidate models are developed) and a holdout / test sample (where we choose between the candidates)

## Summary Statistics (Whole Sample)

```{r}
bind_rows(glance(a1), glance(a2_noint), glance(a3_noint)) %>%
  mutate(model = 
           c("dm_status", "+ healthplan", "+ physhealth")) %>%
  select(model, r.squared, sigma, AIC, BIC, adj.r.squared) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

## `plot(a3_noint)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
  plot(a3_noint)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

# ANOVA and ANCOVA with Multi-Categorical Predictors in Linear Models

## New Questions

1. How does a subject's self-reported general health and their tobacco status combine when predicting their body mass index?
2. Does adjusting for the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week affect our assessment?

## Addressing Question 1: Simple Summary

1. How does a subject's `genhealth` and `smoker` status combine when predicting their body mass index?

```{r, message = FALSE}
smart1_sh %$% 
  mosaic::favstats(bmi ~ smoker + genhealth) %>%
  rename(smoke.health = smoker.genhealth) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

## Visualize Three Variables (Code)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(smart1_sh, aes(x = genhealth, y = bmi, 
                      fill = smoker)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, notch = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~ smoker, labeller = label_both) +
  coord_flip() +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

## Visualize Three Variables

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(smart1_sh, aes(x = genhealth, y = bmi, 
                      fill = smoker)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, notch = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~ smoker, labeller = label_both) +
  coord_flip() +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

## Interaction Plot 

We'll plot the means of the `bmi` in the fifteen combinations:

- three levels of `smoker` combined with
- five levels of `genhealth`

```{r}
summaries4 <- smart1_sh %>% 
  group_by(genhealth, smoker) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), mean = mean(bmi), stdev = sd(bmi))

summaries4 %>% knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

## Interaction Plot for Two-Way ANOVA (code)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pd <- position_dodge(0.2)
ggplot(summaries4, aes(x = genhealth, y = mean,
                       col = smoker)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - stdev,
                    ymax = mean + stdev),
                width = 0.2, position = pd) +
  geom_point(size = 2, position = pd) +
  geom_line(aes(group = smoker), position = pd) +
  labs(y = "Body-Mass Index",
       x = "Self-Reported General Health",
       title = "Observed Means (+/- SD) for BMI", 
       subtitle = "by General Health and Tobacco Status")
```

## Interaction Plot for Two-Way ANOVA

```{r, echo = FALSE}
pd <- position_dodge(0.2)
ggplot(summaries4, aes(x = genhealth, y = mean,
                       col = smoker)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - stdev,
                    ymax = mean + stdev),
                width = 0.2, position = pd) +
  geom_point(size = 2, position = pd) +
  geom_line(aes(group = smoker), position = pd) +
  labs(y = "Body-Mass Index",
       x = "Self-Reported General Health",
       title = "Observed Means (+/- SD) for BMI", 
       subtitle = "by General Health and Tobacco Status")
```

## Two-Way Analysis of Variance

```{r}
a4 <- smart1_sh %$% lm(bmi ~ genhealth * smoker)

anova(a4) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

## Model `a4` tidied coefficients

```{r}
tidy(a4, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.90) %>%
  select(term, estimate, std.error, conf.low, conf.high, p.value) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

## The Equations

The model with the interaction term is

```
BMI = 26.25 + 0.74 (genhealth = Very Good)  
            + 1.88 (genhealth = Good) 
            + ...
            + 2.48 (genhealth = Poor)
            + 0.40 (smoker = Former) 
            - 0.29 (smoker = Never) 
            + 0.66 (genhealth = Very Good)(smoker = Former)
            + ...
            + 1.09 (genhealth = Very Good)(smoker = Never)
            + ...
            + 3.88 (genhealth = Poor)(smoker = Never)
```

- Predict Harry, who's in Excellent health but a Current smoker
- Predict Sally, who's in Very Good Health and a Former smoker

## Is the interaction term important here?

1. Does the interaction plot display important non-parallelism?
2. Does the interaction term account for a substantial fraction of the variation in our outcome?
3. Does the interaction term's estimate/standard error/uncertainty interval meet usual standards for statistical significance?

- See the next 3 slides for the answers...

## Interaction Plot, again...

```{r, echo = FALSE}
pd <- position_dodge(0.2)
ggplot(summaries4, aes(x = genhealth, y = mean,
                       col = smoker)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - stdev,
                    ymax = mean + stdev),
                width = 0.2, position = pd) +
  geom_point(size = 2, position = pd) +
  geom_line(aes(group = smoker), position = pd) +
  labs(y = "Body-Mass Index",
       x = "Self-Reported General Health",
       title = "Observed Means (+/- SD) for BMI", 
       subtitle = "by General Health and Tobacco Status")
```

## Fraction of Variation accounted for by Interaction

```{r}
anova(a4) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 0)
```

- SS(total) = 14,912 + 2,198 + 943 + 285,094 = 303,147.
- SS(interaction) = 943
- $\eta^2$(interaction) = $\frac{943}{303147} = .0031$, or about 0.31% of `bmi` variation.

## Are the interaction terms statistically significant?

```{r}
a4 <- smart1_sh %$% lm(bmi ~ genhealth * smoker)
a4_noint <- smart1_sh %$% lm(bmi ~ genhealth + smoker)

anova(a4_noint, a4)
```

So which model should we use? (Interaction or No Interaction)

## Equation for the Interaction Model (`a4`)

```
bmi = 26.248 
  + 0.741 (genhealth = Very Good) 
  + 1.875 (genhealth = Good)
  + 2.637 (genhealth = Fair) 
  + 2.481 (genhealth = Poor) 
  + 0.397 (smoker = Former) 
  - 0.293 (smoker = Never) 
  + 0.658 (Very Good)(Former) 
  + 1.493 (Good)(Former)
  + 1.475 (Fair)(Former) 
  + 1.560 (Poor)(Former)
  + 1.093 (Very Good)(Never) 
  + 1.610 (Good)(Never)
  + 2.452 (Fair)(Never) 
  + 3.878 (Poor)(Never)
```  

## Comparing Harry and Sally (interaction model)

Scenario | Subject | `genhealth` | `smoker` 
-------: | ------: | --------: | -------:
1 | Harry | Very Good | Current
1 | Sally | Very Good | Never

- Harry's predicted BMI is 26.248 + 0.741 = 26.989
- Sally's predicted BMI is 26.248 + 0.741 - 0.293 + 0.658 = 27.354
- If genhealth Very Good, effect of Never vs. Current is 0.365

Scenario | Subject | `genhealth` | `smoker`

- Sally's predicted BMI is 26.248 + 2.481 - 0.293 + 3.878 = 32.314
- If genhealth Poor, effect of Never vs. Current is 3.585

## Comparing Harry and Sally (interaction model)

Scenario | Subject | `genhealth` | `smoker` 
-------: | ------: | --------: | -------:
3 | Harry | Very Good | Current
3 | Sally | Poor | Current

- Harry's predicted BMI is 26.248 + 0.741 = 26.989
- Sally's predicted BMI is 26.248 + 2.481 = 28.729
- If Current smoker, effect of Poor vs. Very Good is 1.740

Scenario | Subject | `genhealth` | `smoker` 
-------: | ------: | --------: | -------:
4 | Harry | Very Good | Never
4 | Sally | Poor | Never

- Harry's predicted BMI is 26.248 + 0.741 - 0.293 + 1.093 = 27.789
- Sally's predicted BMI is 26.248 + 2.481 - 0.293 + 3.878 = 32.314
- If Never smoker, effect of Poor vs. Very Good is 4.525

## Residual Plots for model `a4`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(a4)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

## Would using `log(BMI)` make the difference?

```{r}
a4_log <- smart1_sh %$% lm(log(bmi) ~ genhealth * smoker)

anova(a4_log) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

## Residual Plots for model `a4_log`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(a4_log)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

## What if we add a covariate?

```{r}
smart1_sh <- smart1_sh %>%
  mutate(drinks_c = drinks_wk - mean(drinks_wk))

a5_log <- smart1_sh %$% 
  lm(log(bmi) ~ drinks_c + genhealth * smoker)

anova(a5_log) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

1. Can we make predictions? 
2. Why center the `drinks_wk`?

## Equation for model `a5_log`

```
log(BMI) = = 3.248 
  - 0.0014 drinks_c
  + 0.033 (genhealth = Very Good) 
  + 0.063 (genhealth = Good)
  + 0.087 (genhealth = Fair) 
  + 0.067 (genhealth = Poor) 
  + 0.025 (smoker = Former) 
  - 0.005 (smoker = Never) 
  + 0.013 (Very Good)(Former) 
  + 0.045 (Good)(Former)
  + 0.041 (Fair)(Former) 
  + 0.052 (Poor)(Former)
  + 0.031 (Very Good)(Never) 
  + 0.053 (Good)(Never)
  + 0.074 (Fair)(Never) 
  + 0.125 (Poor)(Never)
```  

## Comparing Models

- Does the addition of the covariate add statistically detectable predictive value?

```{r}
anova(a4_log, a5_log)
```

## Comparing Models

```{r}
bind_rows(glance(a4_log), glance(a5_log)) %>%

         adjr2 = adj.r.squared) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = c(0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3))
```

What if we have a binary outcome?
