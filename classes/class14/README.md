## Thoughts from Smart People

1. A useful piece of advice for academics from [Dr. Holly Witteman](https://twitter.com/hwitteman/status/1234968102263230464?s=11)

2. A powerful piece of insight from [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1103066293190615041) and from [Paul Sochacki](https://twitter.com/Cyberskout99/status/1103095572288827392) back in 2019.

## Today's Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 14](http://bit.ly/432-2020-minute-14), due at 2 PM on Friday 2020-03-06.
2. The [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book/) have been updated to include Chapters 16, 18, and 21-24, along with placeholders for 17, 19 and 20. I also fixed a couple of typos near the bottom of Chapter 14, in the text describing validation results.
3. For Project 2, I specified [some data sources I'd be pleased to see used more](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/projects/project2/README.md#suggested-data-sources). 

## Some Project 1 Tips

I'm moving these to the [Project 1 Late Hints](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/projects/project1/latehints.md) page.

## Regarding `431-help` and Project 1

- `431-help` remains open through Spring Break, but there will be a noticeable slowdown in response times after Sunday at 9 AM.
- Dr. Love will be (essentially) away from email from Friday evening until Thursday morning, with one exception.
    - On Sunday morning at 9 AM, he will review and try to catch up on anything needing his input, ideally finishing that by Sunday at 10 AM. So if you have questions about Project 1 that you think he needs to see, please send them to `431-help` before 9 AM Sunday.
- Anything received after 9 AM Sunday at `431-help` will eventually get addressed, but it's very possible that this help may not come in time for your Project 1. 
- So, we do not promise to respond to any `431-help` questions received after 9 AM Sunday, in time for Project 1. You can ask, certainly, and the TAs will usually be able to help, but Dr. Love cannot guarantee a response.

## Project 1 Submission Deadline

However, this comes with some "good" news. Because Dr. Love will now be unable to start grading the Projects until Wednesday evening, he is extending the deadline for the Portfolio and Poster by 48 hours. They are now due to Canvas at 2 PM on **Wednesday 2020-03-11**.

You will submit the following items to Canvas:

1. Your Project 1 Portfolio (Rmd and HTML versions)
    - We'd like the filenames (if your name was Jane Smith and your final version was from 2020-03-11) to be `portfolio_jane_smith_2020-03-11.Rmd` and `portfolio_jane_smith_2020-03-11.HTML`.
2. Your Project 1 Poster (Rmd and HTML versions)
    - We'd like the filenames (if your name was Jane Smith and your final version was from 2020-03-11) to be `poster_jane_smith_2020-03-11.Rmd` and `poster_jane_smith_2020-03-11.HTML`.
3. Your raw data set(s) as a csv just as you imported them into R in your portfolio
    - No reason to change the filename here. Use whatever you've used previously.
4. Your tidy data set saved as an Rds (R data set) file. This is so that you preserve all of the factor work you've done. Save your R data set to a file in this way by typing in `saveRDS(nameoftidyRtibble, file = here("data", "tidy_yourname.Rds"))`, subsituting in the name of your tidied R tibble. You can do this after section 12 of your portfolio, just before you run the system information function.
    - We'd like the filename to be `tidy_jane_smith.Rds`. 

Thank you.

## One Last Thing

The map below [appeared in an article on CNBC.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/26/people-skipping-medically-necessary-drugs-because-they-cost-too-much.html) on 2020-02-26.

[Alyssa Keiko](https://twitter.com/alyssakeiko/status/1233092947987529728) tweeted it out, saying "I have a lot of questions about if anyone looked at this map before during or after its making"

Any thoughts as to what happened here?

[Sam Ventura on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stat_sam/status/1233191157053693953?s=11) has the answer, I think...

If you're concerned about Alabama, later in that thread, Sam reminds us that 

> Wyoming + 1 = Alabama, if you go 'round the corner.

By 2020-02-28, CNBC corrected the map, which now looks like this:
