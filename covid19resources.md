    > I (David) show how to open and explore the CORD-19 dataset of scientific publications related to COVID-19 (coronavirus). This includes parsing json files with jsonlite, rectangling the data with tidyr's hoist and unnest_wider, and doing named entity recognition by combining tidytext with the spacyr package and scispacy models.
    - The [CORD data set is housed by Kaggle as part of a research challenge here](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).
- [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's covid19-r repository](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/covid19-r/blob/master/README.md) gathers analyses on and representations of COVID-19 data in R.

- Several posters have linked to this [Epidemic Calculator](http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html) by Gabriel Goh (and others) which lets you play around with various simulations. If you like it, great. I make no claims about its accuracy. I got more from the [NY Times piece from 2020-03-25](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/25/opinion/coronavirus-trump-reopen-america.html) for which Gabriel's work was a key starting point.
- FiveThirtyEight, unsurprisingly, is producing more and more material on the [impact (politically, economically and otherwise) of the novel Coronavirus](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/coronavirus/).
- Weichuan Dong, a spatial analyst in PQHS here at CWRU posted this [public Tableau dashboard of US state responses](https://public.tableau.com/profile/weichuan.dong#!/vizhome/USGovernorsResponsesonCoronavirus/GovernorTwitter). He'd be interested in hearing any suggestions you have.
- [This tweet from JD Long on 2020-03-24](https://twitter.com/CMastication/status/1242392769127157761?s=20) highlights a [visualization of the outbreak by @shinyps](https://twitter.com/shinyps1/status/1242324692620345345/photo/1) that I agree does several things well.
