    > I (David) show how to open and explore the CORD-19 dataset of scientific publications related to COVID-19 (coronavirus). This includes parsing json files with jsonlite, rectangling the data with tidyr's hoist and unnest_wider, and doing named entity recognition by combining tidytext with the spacyr package and scispacy models.
    - The [CORD data set is housed by Kaggle as part of a research challenge here](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).

### Things posted since 2020-03-21

- [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's covid19-r repository](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/covid19-r/blob/master/README.md) gathers analyses on and representations of COVID-19 data in R.
    - A post that Mine links to that I found interesting: ["Ten Considerations Before You Create Another Chart About COVID-19"](https://medium.com/nightingale/ten-considerations-before-you-create-another-chart-about-covid-19-27d3bd691be8)
- My friend from graduate school, Alan Salzberg, weighs in with "[It's All About Stopping Exponential Growth](https://salthillstatistics.com/posts/59)".
- Several posters have linked to this [Epidemic Calculator](http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html) by Gabriel Goh (and others) which lets you play around with various simulations. If you like it, great. I make no claims about its accuracy.
- FiveThirtyEight, unsurprisingly, is producing more and more material on the [impact (politically, economically and otherwise) of the novel Coronavirus](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/coronavirus/).
- Weichuan Dong, a spatial analyst in PQHS here at CWRU posted this [public Tableau dashboard of US state responses](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/coronavirus/). He'd be interested in hearing any suggestions you have - you can send them to 431-help if you like, and we'll be sure to get them to Weichuan.
- [This tweet from JD Long on 2020-03-24](https://twitter.com/CMastication/status/1242392769127157761?s=20) highlights a [visualization of the outbreak by @shinyps](https://twitter.com/shinyps1/status/1242324692620345345/photo/1) that I agree does several things well.
