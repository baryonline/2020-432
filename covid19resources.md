    > I (David) show how to open and explore the CORD-19 dataset of scientific publications related to COVID-19 (coronavirus). This includes parsing json files with jsonlite, rectangling the data with tidyr's hoist and unnest_wider, and doing named entity recognition by combining tidytext with the spacyr package and scispacy models.
    - The [CORD data set is housed by Kaggle as part of a research challenge here](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).
