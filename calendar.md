## So ... Everything below this line is just an archive of previous materials.

# We live in interesting times. What's the new plan for 432?

First, please don't panic or worry. We will get through this situation. 

My Number One Goal (and that of the TAs) is to be kind to you and to each other. 

- If you're worrying about some element of this course, *please* talk to us. 
    - Use 431-help for now, or email Dr. Love directly if you prefer.
    - We'll work it out, if there's any way at all to do so.
    - We're all under a strain, and suffering in silence is the thing to avoid.
    
## Please fill out this form...

http://bit.ly/love-2020-covid-form-1

## Take a look at [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FYeQjzmDf6tXoirlriWTWErQSLLwLz45RTBu_R-yBhc/edit?usp=sharing) from Dr. Love written 2020-03-12.

## Here's What Dr. Love Knows As Of Now

1. Our planned class on 2020-03-17 is cancelled.
2. Our planned TA in-person office hours on 2020-03-16 and 2020-03-17 are cancelled.
3. `431-help` is open now and will be through the end of April, at least.
4. We will definitely be having class in some kind of virtual way (with no in-person option) from 2020-03-19 through 2020-04-02, and that may be extended all the way to the end of the semester.
5. Whatever that virtual class turns out to be, I will do everything I can to make video and audio recordings available after the sessions.
6. Once you've submitted Project 1 to Canvas (due 10 AM on Thursday 2020-03-12), the next two deliverables are:
    - Homework 4, which is still due to Canvas on 2020-03-23 at 5 PM.
    - Reading through Chapter 12 of Spiegelhalter's ART before 2020-03-26.
7. Everything else, including Quizzes 2 and 3, Assignments 5 and 6, and Project 2, and even the order in which we discuss new materials, are all subject to meaningful change. I hope to have all of that figured out by Monday 2020-03-16 at 5 PM.

## What Dr. Love will be doing...

Starting at about 10 AM Thursday 2020-03-12, and continuing through Monday 2020-03-16, I will:

- work my way through as many of the projects as I can, and 
- plan for the rest of the semester (as if we'll never all be in the same room again during that time.) 

By **5 PM Monday 2020-03-16**, I intend to post a substantial update to this page covering the results of those two activities. I ask you to be patient before that time, as I try to figure things out. 

*If you have a concern that you want me to be sure to address in what I post on Monday, please send that concern along via email. I will of course follow the guidance of the University.*

Teaching Assistant Office Hours are held in **either** WG-56 (Computing Lab) or WG-67 (Student Lounge) on the ground floor of the Wood building in the School of Medicine, so be sure to look in both places if you need help. The TAs will do everything they can to cover these time periods, but if for some reason, you can't find someone at the times listed below, email `431-help`, please.
