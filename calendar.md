## TAs and Office Hours

- To contact the TAs (and Dr. Love) at any time, email `431-help` at `case dot edu`.
- `431-help` opens immediately after our first class on 2020-01-14, and remains open until the end of April.

This semester's TAs are:  [Benjamin (Ben) Booker, BS](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-syllabus/teaching-assistants.html), [Julijana Conic, MD](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-syllabus/teaching-assistants.html), [Joseph Hnath, BA](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-syllabus/teaching-assistants.html), [Amr Mahran, MD MS](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-syllabus/teaching-assistants.html), [Amin Saad, MD](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-syllabus/teaching-assistants.html) and [Jing Zhang, MD MS](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-syllabus/teaching-assistants.html). Profiles and photographs of each of the teaching assistants are found in the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-syllabus/teaching-assistants.html).

Teaching Assistant Office Hours are held in **either** WG-56 (Computing Lab) or WG-67 (Student Lounge) on the ground floor of the Wood building in the School of Medicine, so be sure to look in both places if you need help. The TAs will do everything they can to cover these time periods, but if for some reason, you can't find someone at the times listed below, email `431-help`, please.
