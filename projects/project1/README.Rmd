As a substantial part of your course grade, you will complete two Projects this semester. This document describes Project 1. Instructions for Project 2 will appear later in the term.

# Introduction

It is hard to learn statistics (or anything else) passively; concurrent theory and application are essential. Expert clinical researchers and statisticians repeatedly emphasize how important it is that people be able to write well, present clearly, work to solve problems, and show initiative. This project assignment is designed to help you develop your abilities and have a memorable experience. 

In Project 1, you will be analyzing, presenting and discussing a pair of regression models, specifically a linear regression and a logistic regression, describing a data set you identify. 

## Project 1 involves two tasks.

1. Develop a proposal, which includes a presentation of the data. This proposal is due in mid-February. The proposal is graded by the TAs using a formal rubric prepared by Dr. Love. You will iterate (as necessary) on your proposal until you receive full credit. The proposal is worth 50% of the project 1 grade. This document describes the proposal in detail.

2. Develop an electronic poster of your work. This poster is due in early March. The poster is evaluated by Dr. Love. The poster is worth the remaining 50% of the project 1 grade. Details on the poster will be provided by 2020-01-28.

See the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md) for deadlines.

## Am I working alone, or in a group?

You can choose either to work alone, or with one other person, to complete Project 1.

- At times, we may require you to share drafts of your work with other people in small groups, but the actual data collection, analysis and report-building work is for you (or you and your partner) to do.

## What Makes an Acceptable Data Set?

1. **Shareable with the World**. The data must be available to you, and shared with me and everyone else in the world (without any identifying information) as a well-tidied .csv file on 2020-02-14. If the data is from another source, the source (web or other) must be completely identified to me. Ongoing projects that require anyone's approval to share data are not appropriate for Project 1, but can be used (with Dr. Love's approval) for Project 2. 
    - You should have the data in R by 2020-02-05, so that you will have sufficient time to complete the other elements of this proposal. Any data you cannot have by that time is a bad choice.
    - For Project 1, you may not use any data set that was used in the 431 or 432 teaching materials. You may not use any data set included in [an R package that we are installing](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/software.md) this semester, other than NHANES. 
    - You must use meaningfully different data sets in 432 Projects 1 and 2.
    - You **are** allowed to use NHANES data in Project 1, but only if you are combining information from at least three NHANES data sets. If you used NHANES data in your 431 project, you can use NHANES data again this semester, but you must study new outcomes.
    - You are permitted to use BRFSS data, but you are not permitted to use data from SMART BRFSS, since we will be using that regularly in class.

2. **Size**. A **minimum** of 100 complete observations are required on each variable. It is fine if there are some missing values, as well, so long as there are at least 100 rows with complete observations on all variables you intend to use in each model. The **maximum** data set size is 1000 observations, so if you have something larger than that, you'll need to select a subset.

3. **Outcomes**. The columns must include at least one quantitative outcome and one binary categorical outcome. If necessary, the binary outcome can be generated from the quantitative outcome (as an example, your quantitative outcome could be resting heart rate in beats per minute, and your binary outcome could be whether the resting heart rate is below 70 beats per minute.)

4. **Inputs**. You will need at least four regression inputs (predictors) for each of your two models. At least one of the four must be quantitative (a variable is **not** quantitative for this purpose unless it has at least 10 different, ordered, observed values), *and* at least one must be multi-categorical (with at least 3 categories, each containing a minimum of 30 subjects) for each model. Your other inputs can represent binary, multi-categorical or quantitative data. You can examine different candidate predictors for each outcome, or use the same ones in both your linear and logistic regression models. Depending on your sample size, you can study more regression inputs. Specifically, if you have N complete observations in your data set, you are permitted to study up to 4 + (N-100)/100 candidate regression inputs, rounding down.

# Deliverable 1. The Proposal

The proposal is to be submitted via file uploads to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

Your proposal will include 
    - (a) a single `.csv` file of the data you have chosen
    - (b) a R Markdown file containing the information listed below, and 
    - (c) an HTML document which is the unedited result of knitting your Markdown file.

## The Nine Parts of Your Proposal

The nine pieces of information we should find in the Markdown and HTML versions of your proposal are:

1. Complete information on the source of the data: how did you get it, how was it gathered, by whom, in what setting, for what purpose, and using what sampling strategy.
2. Code to load the raw `.csv` file into a tibble, and tidy/clean up the data to be useful for your modeling work. 
3. A listing of the tibble, with all variables correctly imported (via your code) as the types of variables (factor/integer/numeric, etc.) that you need for modeling. Be sure that your listing specifies the number of rows and number of columns in your tidy data set.
4. A description (one or two sentences) of who or what the subjects (rows) are in your data set.
5. A code book, which provides, for each variable in your tibble, the following information:
    + The name of the variable used in your tibble
    + The type of variable (binary, multi-categorical, quantitative)
    + The details for each variable 
        * if a categorical variable, what are the levels, and what % of subjects fall in each category
        * if a quantitative variable, what is the range of the data, and what are the units of measurement
        * if there are missing data, tell us how many observations are missing, and why, if you know why.
6. A sentence or two for each variable (column) providing a description of what the variable measures or describes, in English.
7. A sentence or two telling us what you will use your linear regression model to explain or predict, *followed by* a sentence or several telling us very precisely which (quantitative) variable will serve as your outcome in your linear regression model, and which four (or more) candidate predictors you intend to use for that model.
8. A sentence or two telling us what you will use your logistic regression model to explain or predict, *followed by* a sentence or several telling us very precisely which (binary) variable will serve as your outcome in your logistic regression model, and which four (or more) candidate predictors you intend to use for that model.
9. An affirmation that the data set meets all of the requirements specified here, most especially that the data can be shared freely over the internet, and that there is no protected information of any kind involved. You need to be able to write "I am certain that it is completely appropriate for these data to be shared with anyone, without any conditions. There are no concerns about privacy or security." If you are unsure whether this is true, select a different data set.

### Evaluating the Project 1 Proposal

- Your project will be evaluated on a scale of 0-10, with one point for submitting all necessary materials (.csv, .Rmd and HTML) successfully, and then one additional point for each of the nine tasks if they are successfully completed. 
- If you receive a grade lower than 10, you will need to redo until you reach 10. Redos are expected within 48 hours of receipt of the redo request.

The full [Project 1 Proposal Rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/projects/project1/project1_proposal_rubric.md) is available now. Please review that material closely, so that your submission will meet all requirements and score a 10 on the first try.

## The Group Meetings

- On 2020-02-27, you will meet during class time to present your proposal work, and any subsequent work you have completed on your portfolio. This important session will give you the opportunity  to present a piece of your work to some of your colleagues, and get meaningful feedback from them on the decisions you have made. The TAs will run this session, as Dr. Love will be out of town.
