As a substantial part of your course grade, you will complete two Projects this semester. This document describes Project 1. Instructions for Project 2 will appear later in the term.

# Introduction

It is hard to learn statistics (or anything else) passively; concurrent theory and application are essential. Expert clinical researchers and statisticians repeatedly emphasize how important it is that people be able to write well, present clearly, work to solve problems, and show initiative. This project assignment is designed to help you develop your abilities and have a memorable experience. 

In Project 1, you will be analyzing, presenting and discussing a pair of regression models, specifically a linear regression and a logistic regression, describing a data set you identify. 

## Project 1 involves two tasks.

1. Develop a proposal, which includes a presentation of the data. This proposal is due in mid-February. The proposal is graded by the TAs using a formal rubric prepared by Dr. Love. You will iterate (as necessary) on your proposal until you receive full credit. The proposal is worth 25% of the project 1 grade, and the portfolio version of the portfolio that you will submit as part of the second task is worth another 25%. 

2. Develop an electronic poster of your work. This poster is due in early March. The poster is evaluated by Dr. Love. The poster is worth the remaining 50% of the project 1 grade. 

See the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md) for deadlines.

## Am I working alone, or in a group?

You can choose either to work alone, or with one other person, to complete Project 1.

- At times, we may require you to share drafts of your work with other people in small groups, but the actual data collection, analysis and report-building work is for you (or you and your partner) to do.

## What Makes an Acceptable Data Set?

1. **Shareable with the World**. The data must be available to you, and shared with me and everyone else in the world (without any identifying information) as a well-tidied .csv file on 2020-02-14. If the data is from another source, the source (web or other) must be completely identified to me. Ongoing projects that require anyone's approval to share data are not appropriate for Project 1, but can be used (with Dr. Love's approval) for Project 2. 
    - You should have the data in R by 2020-02-05, so that you will have sufficient time to complete the other elements of this proposal. Any data you cannot have by that time is a bad choice.
    - For Project 1, you may not use any data set that was used in the 431 or 432 teaching materials. You may not use any data set included in [an R package that we are installing](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/software.md) this semester, other than NHANES. 
    - You must use meaningfully different data sets in 432 Projects 1 and 2.
    - You **are** allowed to use NHANES data in Project 1, but only if you are combining information from at least three NHANES data sets. If you used NHANES data in your 431 project, you can use NHANES data again this semester, but you must study new outcomes.
    - You are permitted to use BRFSS data, but you are not permitted to use data from SMART BRFSS, since we will be using that regularly in class.

2. **Size**. A **minimum** of 100 complete observations are required on each variable. It is fine if there are some missing values, as well, so long as there are at least 100 rows with complete observations on all variables you intend to use in each model. The **maximum** data set size is 1000 observations, so if you have something larger than that, you'll need to select a subset.

3. **Outcomes**. The columns must include at least one quantitative outcome and one binary categorical outcome. If necessary, the binary outcome can be generated from the quantitative outcome (as an example, your quantitative outcome could be resting heart rate in beats per minute, and your binary outcome could be whether the resting heart rate is below 70 beats per minute.)

4. **Inputs**. You will need at least four regression inputs (predictors) for each of your two models. At least one of the four must be quantitative (a variable is **not** quantitative for this purpose unless it has at least 10 different, ordered, observed values), *and* at least one must be multi-categorical (with at least 3 categories, each containing a minimum of 30 subjects) for each model. Your other inputs can represent binary, multi-categorical or quantitative data. You can examine different candidate predictors for each outcome, or use the same ones in both your linear and logistic regression models. Depending on your sample size, you can study more regression inputs. Specifically, if you have N complete observations in your data set, you are permitted to study up to 4 + (N-100)/100 candidate regression inputs, rounding down.

# Deliverable 1. The Proposal

The proposal is to be submitted via file uploads to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

Your proposal will include 
    - (a) a single `.csv` file of the data you have chosen
    - (b) a R Markdown file containing the information listed below, and 
    - (c) an HTML document which is the unedited result of knitting your Markdown file.

## The Nine Parts of Your Proposal

The nine pieces of information we should find in the Markdown and HTML versions of your proposal are:

1. Complete information on the source of the data: how did you get it, how was it gathered, by whom, in what setting, for what purpose, and using what sampling strategy.
2. Code to load the raw `.csv` file into a tibble, and tidy/clean up the data to be useful for your modeling work. 
3. A listing of the tibble, with all variables correctly imported (via your code) as the types of variables (factor/integer/numeric, etc.) that you need for modeling. Be sure that your listing specifies the number of rows and number of columns in your tidy data set.
4. A description (one or two sentences) of who or what the subjects (rows) are in your data set.
5. A code book, which provides, for each variable in your tibble, the following information:
    + The name of the variable used in your tibble
    + The type of variable (binary, multi-categorical, quantitative)
    + The details for each variable 
        * if a categorical variable, what are the levels, and what % of subjects fall in each category
        * if a quantitative variable, what is the range of the data, and what are the units of measurement
        * if there are missing data, tell us how many observations are missing, and why, if you know why.
6. A sentence or two for each variable (column) providing a description of what the variable measures or describes, in English.
7. A sentence or two telling us what you will use your linear regression model to explain or predict, *followed by* a sentence or several telling us very precisely which (quantitative) variable will serve as your outcome in your linear regression model, and which four (or more) candidate predictors you intend to use for that model.
8. A sentence or two telling us what you will use your logistic regression model to explain or predict, *followed by* a sentence or several telling us very precisely which (binary) variable will serve as your outcome in your logistic regression model, and which four (or more) candidate predictors you intend to use for that model.
9. An affirmation that the data set meets all of the requirements specified here, most especially that the data can be shared freely over the internet, and that there is no protected information of any kind involved. You need to be able to write "I am certain that it is completely appropriate for these data to be shared with anyone, without any conditions. There are no concerns about privacy or security." If you are unsure whether this is true, select a different data set.

### Evaluating the Project 1 Proposal

- Your project will be evaluated on a scale of 0-10, with one point for submitting all necessary materials (.csv, .Rmd and HTML) successfully, and then one additional point for each of the nine tasks if they are successfully completed. 
- If you receive a grade lower than 10, you will need to redo until you reach 10. Redos are expected within 48 hours of receipt of the redo request.

The full [Project 1 Proposal Rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/projects/project1/project1_proposal_rubric.md) is available now. Please review that material closely, so that your submission will meet all requirements and score a 10 on the first try.

## Some Additional Thoughts after reviewing the Proposal Drafts

- Revised proposals are due 2020-02-24 at 9 AM. We will attempt to finish reviewing those revisions by 9 PM on 2020-02-24.
- If an additional revision is required, it wil be due 2020-02-26 at 9 AM.

Every proposal should ...

- **not** use `skim_with(numeric = list(hist = NULL), integer = list(hist = NULL))` since it leads to a lengthy and pointless function listing. If you want to skim without charts use `skim_without_charts` which came into existence in 2019.
- **not** use `source("Love-boost.R")` or any other R script or package unless you actually need somethin it provides
- load the tidyverse last, and not anywhere else, and avoid loading other packages that are loaded already by the tidyverse. The complete list of packages that the tidyverse loads is [the set of core packages listed at this link](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/).
- should use **code-folding** in the HTML result (add code_folding: show to your YAML)
- should use the **tidyverse** for data management, almost without exception
- use `message = FALSE` in the code chunk where the packages are listed to eliminate the messages in the HTML showing warnings about when packages were built or how objects were masked
- use `comment = NA` in the setup chunk to avoid R output being preceded by hashtags `##`
- be run using **R version 3.6.2** or later, and include **session info** at the end of the document
- use the ENTER key sufficiently to prevent any code chunks in the HTML file from requiring a scrolling window in order to be seen (note that this is a particularly common problem when people list many, many packages on the same line, separated by semicolons)
- use `clean_names()` to clean up the names in the variables in the final tidied version of the data, and have no names that are longer than they need to be (10 characters or less is a good plan for variable names)
- include a **tidied version of the data file**, in .csv format, perhaps in addition to the raw data, and this tidied version should adhere to the requirements for minimum and maximum number of rows and columns, with a row (subject) identifier at the far left of the .csv file. This is a new and additional requirement for the revised proposal, to demonstrate that you've done the necessary work.

## The Group Meetings

- On 2020-02-27, you will meet during class time to present your proposal work, and any subsequent work you have completed on your portfolio. This important session will give you the opportunity  to present a piece of your work to some of your colleagues, and get meaningful feedback from them on the decisions you have made. The TAs will run this session, as Dr. Love will be out of town.

# Deliverable 2. The Poster and The Portfolio

## The Portfolio

The portfolio submission for Project 1 consists of 13 sections, 9 of which come straight from the proposal, and the last of which requires a single line of code in R.

- Sections 1-9 are the same as what you prepared for the proposal. You should nail down any details that were not yet specified in your original submissions of the proposal. Sections 5-8, in particular, should be adjusted as necessary to reflect the actual analyses you wound up doing.
- Section 10 is **new**, should be labeled "Linear Regression Analyses" and is dedicated to that work.
- Section 11 is **new**, should be labeled "Logistic Regression Analyses" and is dedicated to that work.
- Section 12 is called "Discussion" and is a 100-250 word discussion of your thoughts on the process of producing this project.
- Section 13 is the session info material.

### Section 10: Linear Regression Analyses

In Section 10, we expect you to present all relevant code used to produce your final results. No output should be presented in this section (or in Section 11) without commentary. This should describe the fitting and evaluation of two models: a "main effects" model, and an "augmented" model. We're primarily interested in a clear presentation. The following 8 elements should be presented, in properly labeled subsections of section 10, using the labels in bold below.

1. **Missingness** your approach to dealing with missing data, if applicable
    - we prefer imputation (simple or multiple) to complete case analysis, but it's not mandatory
    - if you have a sample with no missing data, specify that (again) here
2. **Outcome Transformation** your approach to transforming the outcome variable, including an appropriate Box-Cox assessment
3. **Scatterplot Matrix and Collinearity** a scatterplot matrix including the (possibly transformed) outcome and all predictors that make it into your "main effects" model
    - be sure to evaluate collinearity between predictors, either through perusing and discussing the correlations in the scatterplot matrix, or with variance inflation factors
4. **Model A**: your initial "main effects" kitchen sink model
    - remember that your model must include at least four predictors, of which at least one must be quantitative and one must be multi-categorical.
    - we discourage the use of best subsets or other model selection strategies here, instead please use your problem-based understanding to select variables and use them all.
    - in presenting your main effects model you should show:
        - a tidied table of regression coefficients
        - key fit summary statistics like R-square, AIC and BIC, and
        - the four key diagnostic plots of residuals, with an appropriate interpretation of what you see
5. **Non-Linearity** your process for making decisions about how to capture potential non-linearity 
    - what did the Spearman rho-squared plot suggest and how did you spend your degrees of freedom 
        - If the (apparently strongest - furthest to the right) predictor in the rho-square plot is quantitative, you should be thinking first about a restricted cubic spline with 4 knots, maybe 5,
        - If the largest rho-square is associated with a binary or a multi-categorical predictor, create an interaction term with the second-largest rho-squared predictor.
        - If you still have degrees of freedom you're willing to spend after this, proceed down to the second largest predictor in terms of rho-squared, and proceed similarly to the third largest after that.
    - Regardless of your sample size, please use between 3 and 6 additional degrees of freedom beyond the main effects model to account for non-linearity, and add no more than 3 non-linear terms to your model.
6. **Model B**: fitting your "augmented model" incorporating non-linear terms
    - unless you're doing multiple imputation you'll want to be sure you demonstrate that you can fit this using either `ols` or `lm`, since you might need either approach for a complete assessment of the model (if you're doing multiple imputation, you can stick with `ols`)
    - you'll need at a minimum to present a nomogram and plot of the effects from `plot(summary(modelname))` for this augmenmted model, using `ols`.
    - you'll also need to present the residual plots for the model you've fit, which is easiest to do if you fit the model with `lm`.
        - if you've used multiple imputation, prepare a residuals vs. fitted values plot and evaluate it using `ols`.
7. **Validating the Models** the results of a validation comparison of the "augmented model" to the "kitchen sink" model which should help you select a "final model" from the two possibilities. Feasible ways to do this include:
    - an initial partition into training and test samples,
    - or a k-fold cross-validation strategy,
    - perhaps you might also develop validated $R^2$ statistics within `ols` through the `validate` function
8. **Final Model** This section should end with a clear statement of the model you prefer (the "main effects model A" or the "augmented model B") based on your overall assessment of fit quality, adherence to assumptions as seen in residuals, and whether adding the terms in the augmented model yields an improvement that is worth the complication of adding the non-linear terms.
    - You should land on a single, final model, using both statistical and non-statistical considerations to make a decision between model A and model B.
    - An appropriate summary of the final model you landed on should start with a listing of the model parameters with appropriate confidence intervals, and a table or (better) plot of the effect sizes.
        - Specify the effect sizes for all elements of your final model numerically (with both a point estimate and a confidence interval), and graphically (with a plot of those effects (probably through `plot(summary(yourmodel)`).
        - Then write a detailed and correct description of the effect of **at least one** predictor on your outcome for your linear regression model, providing all necessary elements of such a description, and link this directly to what the plot is telling you. 
        - We prefer you discuss a statistically and scientifically meaningful effect, should one exist. Pick an effect to describe that is interesting to you.
    - The final part of your summary of the final model should be a nomogram with a demonstration of a prediction (and appropriate prediction interval) for a new subject of interest.
        - Your prediction (and its prediction interval) should be back transformed to the original scale of your outcome, if you made a transformation back at the beginning of building your model.

### Section 11: Logistic Regression

Details coming soon.

### Section 12: The Discussion

This should be a short (perhaps 200 words) discussion of your thoughts on the entire Project 1 process. Topics to address (pick two of these) include:

- What was substantially harder or easier than you expected?
- What do you wish you'd known at the start of this process that you know now?
- What was the most confusing part of doing the project?
- What was the most useful thing you learned while doing the project?
