# 432 Projects for Spring 2020

This is where information on the course projects will appear. 

- You will do two projects in 432 this semester. 
- Each involves the submission (and approval) of a **proposal** about a month prior to the final project deadline.

1. Project 1 involves linear and logistic regression, is tightly formatted, and must use data that are already available to anyone on Earth.
2. Project 2 is much more flexible in terms of methods and can use data that cannot be shared with Dr. Love.

Meaningful information on the Course Projects will appear no later than 2020-01-21.
