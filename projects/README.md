# 432 Projects for Spring 2020

This is where information on the course projects will appear. 

- You will do two projects in 432 this semester. 
- Each involves the submission (and approval) of a **proposal** about a month prior to the final project deadline.

1. Project 1 involves linear and logistic regression, is tightly formatted, and must use data that are already available to anyone on Earth. 
    - [Project 1 instructions and details are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/project1).
    - [Project 1 templates](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/project1/templates) are available.
    - A list of [accepted Project 1 Proposals](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/projects/project1/approved_proposals.md) is also available.
    - My old (2019) [Project 1 demo](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/2019-project-1-demo) is available, too, for what it's worth.
    
2. Project 2 is much more flexible in terms of methods and can use data that cannot be shared with Dr. Love. 
    - [Partial Project 2 instructions are now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/tree/master/projects/project2).

Information on the Course Projects will continue to appear throughout the semester.
