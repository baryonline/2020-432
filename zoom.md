# Zoom details for 432 in Spring 2020

## Connecting to Class Sessions via Zoom

- The Zoom meetings for our 432 classes will be open from 12:30 PM to 2:30 PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays, beginning 2020-03-19.
    - The classes themselves will start at 1:00 and end by 2:15, but we want to provide some flexibility before and after class for students to chat amongst themselves or with Dr. Love.
- **You will need to register in advance for the meeting using the link sent to your email on 2020-03-17 with the subject line "Invitation to Register for Zoom CLASS MEETINGS for 432 with Professor Love (IMPORTANT)".** After you register, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting. 
    - As I understand it, once you've done this registration the first time, you should then be able to join the subsequent class meetings without re-registering, and the meetings should appear on your Zoom calendar and can be added to your Google Calendar or other time management tools.
- Before class, be sure you've logged into [Zoom via CWRU](https://case.edu/utech/help/knowledge-base/zoom/zoom-information) and obtained the application for your computer or tablet.

## Connecting to TA Office Hours

Teaching Assistant Office Hours will be held virtually starting 2020-03-18 and running through 2020-05-01 via [Zoom](https://case.edu/utech/help/knowledge-base/zoom/zoom-information).

- Details on how to access the Zoom office hours were sent to your email on 2020-03-17, under the subject line: "**Office Hours for 432: Connecting to Zoom TA Office Hours in Spring 2020 (IMPORTANT)**"
- You can, of course, also submit questions via `431-help` at any time.

The schedule for TA office hours is provided [in this section of the Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours).
