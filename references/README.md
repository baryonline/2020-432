# References and Resources for 432 - Spring 2020

This page provides a bibliography and links list for useful texts and related resources we will reference this semester. Some of you will read all of this material, and others will only read selected pieces.

Some of these materials are **password-protected**. The password will be revealed in class.

## Assigned Reading

- Thomas E. Love (2020) [Data Science for Biological, Medical and Health Research: Notes for 432](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book/).
    - This material will evolve over the course of the semester. The 2019 version [for 431](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-book/) and [for 432](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/) are still available.
- David Spiegelhalter (2019) **The Art of Statistics**, which you'll need to purchase.
    - The book is available online for less than $25 in hardcover, and less than $20 as an e-book. [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-How-Learn-Data/dp/1541618513).
    - Here's [the book's website](https://dspiegel29.github.io/ArtofStatistics/) which contains R code, corrections and other materials.
- Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
    - We expect you've already read the *Explore* section (Chapters 1-8), and the *Wrangle* section (especially Chapters 9-12 and 15) reasonably closely before taking 432. If not, get on that soon. 
    - During 432, we recommend that you read the *Communicate* section (Chapters 26-30) by the end of February.
    - The *Model* section (Chapters 22-25) should also be of some interest, although we won't do much with `modelr` in class. Most of you should skim the *Program* section and rest of the book.
- Karl W. Broman & Kara H. Woo (2018) [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/references/pdf/Broman_and_Woo_2018_Data_Organization_in_Spreadsheets.pdf), *The American Statistician*, 72:1, 2-10, DOI: [10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) will be discussed early in the semester.
- Frank Harrell & others (2019-) [Glossary of Statistical Terms](http://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf) will be discussed throughout the semester.
- [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research](http://hbiostat.org/bbr/) (pdf file) by Frank E. Harrell, Jr. and James C. Slaughter is a nice source for a lot of things we'll be using in 432, plus a review and different spin on a lot of things from 431. It is freely available (and regularly updated) [online](http://hbiostat.org/bbr/).
    - Frank's video course on (some of) this material is [at YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o_ZZ0tuFUYn8e8rf-QURA/videos).
- [Common statistical tests are linear models](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/) by Jonas Kristoffer Lindel√∏v.
- [Statistical Inference in the 21st Century: A World Beyond *p* < 0.05](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/toc/utas20/73/sup1) from 2019 in *The American Statistician*
- The American Statistical Association's 2016 [Statement on p-Values](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108): Context, Process and Purpose.

## Other Useful References

- Jeff Leek's short book "[How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist)" (recommended price $10) was a mandatory part of the 432 course for the past few years. It's still worth your time and money, if you're interested.
- [datamethods](https://discourse.datamethods.org/) "is a place where statisticians, epidemiologists, informaticists, machine learning practitioners, and other research methodologists communicate with themselves and with clinical, translational, and health services researchers to discuss issues related to data: research methods, quantitative methods, study design, measurement, statistical analysis, interpretation of data and statistical results, clinical trials, journal articles, statistical graphics, causal inference, medical decision making, and more."
