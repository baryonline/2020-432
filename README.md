## What Should I Do Prior to the First Class?

1. **Buy The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data** by David Spiegelhalter. 
    - We'll read the entire book this Spring, but I encourage you to read Chapters 1-5 soon.
    - The book is available online for less than $25 in hardcover, and less than $20 as an e-book. [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-How-Learn-Data/dp/1541618513).
    - Here's [the book's website](https://dspiegel29.github.io/ArtofStatistics/) which contains code, corrections and other materials.

2. **Install the Software**: Install R (version 3.6.2 or later) and RStudio (version 1.2.5033 or later) and some necessary R packages. [Details here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/software.md).

3. Materials will continue to appear on the web in fits and starts all semester. Take a look at what's already up.

## Staying Sharp over the Break

The best thing to do is analyze some data. I can think of no better place to keep sharp than working on some of the [Tidy Tuesday projects](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/post/tidytuesday-a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r/) and I hope to spend some time on this myself over the break. There's a new data set every week!

- For instance, the [data for the week of 2019-12-03 involves parking violations in the city of Philadelphia](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-12-03).
- Here's the complete [list of 2019 data sets to date](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#2019).
- David Robinson's [video series continues on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/safe4democracy/videos).
