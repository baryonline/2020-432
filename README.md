# 2020-432

This will be the public web site for my 432 course in Spring 2020 at Case Western Reserve University. 
Materials will appear between now and the start of class on 2020-01-14.

Contact me via email at thomas dot love at case dot edu if you have questions about the course that are not answered here.

## Materials for 432

- **When will the syllabus, etc. be posted?** I won't guarantee any time before our first class at 1 PM on 2020-01-14, but I'll do what I can to get something up meaningfully sooner. I'd be surprised if anything substantial was up before the New Year.

## What do I need to purchase?

- I encourage you to read at least Chapters 1-5 of **The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data** by David Spiegelhalter over the break. We'll read the entire book through the Spring semester, but there's no reason not to read the whole thing in advance. Available for between $20 and $25 in hardcover, less as an e-book. Here's [the book's website](https://dspiegel29.github.io/ArtofStatistics/). I don't know yet whether this is the only book you'll have to buy for 432, or one of two books, but you do need to buy the Spiegelhalter.
- The other book you *might* need to buy and read is Jeff Leek's [How to Be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist) which is great but getting a little bit out of date. So I'm not sure yet whether you need to buy this or whether I'll go another way.

## What other books will we be using?

- [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research](http://hbiostat.org/bbr/) (pdf file) by Frank E. Harrell, Jr. and James C. Slaughter is a nice source for a lot of things we'll be using in 432, plus a review and different spin on a lot of things from 431. It is freely available (and regularly updated) [online](http://hbiostat.org/bbr/).
    - Frank's video course on (some of) this material is [ongoing at YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o_ZZ0tuFUYn8e8rf-QURA/videos).
- [Common statistical tests are linear models](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/) by Jonas Kristoffer Lindel√∏v.
- Dr. Love's Course Notes will be edited and rewritten over the break, he hopes. 
    - In the meantime, [here's the Spring 2019 version](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/) which is posted here with no guarantees.

## Staying Sharp over the Break

The best thing to do is analyze some data. I can think of no better place to keep sharp than working on some of the [Tidy Tuesday projects](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/post/tidytuesday-a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r/) and I hope to spend some time on this myself over the break. There's a new data set every week!

- For instance, the [data for the week of 2019-12-03 involves parking violations in the city of Philadelphia](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-12-03).
- Here's the complete [list of 2019 data sets to date](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#2019).
- David Robinson's [video series continues on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/safe4democracy/videos).
